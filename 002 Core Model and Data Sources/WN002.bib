abstract = {The global imbalance explanation of the financial crisis of 2007–09 suggests that demand for riskless assets from countries with current account surpluses created fragility in countries with current account deficits, most notably in the United States. This paper examines this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits set up by large commercial banks. The paper shows that banks in surplus countries as well as banks in deficit countries manufactured riskless assets, totaling over \$1.2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U.S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U.S. assets. As negative information about U.S. assets became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and deficit countries experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result suffered significant losses. The paper concludes that global banking flows, rather than global imbalances, determined the geography of the financial crisis.},

abstract = {More than 25 years after the discovery that the equilibrium point of a general equilibrium model is not necessarily either unique or stable, there is still a need for an intuitively comprehensible explanation of the reasons for this discovery. Recent accounts identify two causes of the finding of instability: the inherent difficulties of aggregation, and the individualistic model of consumer behaviour. The mathematical dead end reached by general equilibrium analysis is not due to obscure or esoteric aspects of the model, but rather arises from intentional design features, present in neoclassical theory since its beginnings. Modification of economic theory to overcome these underlying problems will require a new model of consumer choice, nonlinear analyses of social interactions, and recognition of the central role of institutional and social constraints.

abstract = {We provide an overview of the rapidly evolving literature on shadow credit intermediation. The shadow banking system consists of a web of specialized financial institutions that conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation without direct, explicit access to public backstops. The lack of such access to sources of government liquidity and credit backstops makes shadow banks inherently fragile. Much of shadow banking activities is intertwined with the operations of core regulated institutions such as bank holding companies and insurance companies, thus creating a source of systemic risk for the financial system at large. We review fundamental reasons for the existence of shadow banking, explain the functioning of shadow banking institutions and activities, discuss why shadow banks need to be regulated, and review the impact of recent reform efforts on shadow banking credit intermediation.},

From a perspective that focuses on the value and$\backslash$nvolume of gross domestic product, that assessment is valid. The world's major economies enjoyed a$\backslash$nsustained period of growth.

The past decade has borne witness to sharp swings in asset prices and a large expansion in$\backslash$ncredit and balance sheets. This paper considers a flow-of-funds approach that stresses the role of$\backslash$nasset prices, credit and balance sheets. This framework is used to shine a different light on the$\backslash$nGreat Moderation in the United Kingdom. It suggests that there were linkages between many of the$\backslash$nmacroeconomic puzzles of the day and the balance sheet developments that led to financial$\backslash$ninstability. It further argues that approaches to macroeconomics that stress the importance of$\backslash$nbalance sheet linkages might be helpful in spotting building financial fragility.},

abstract = {The output effects of 2009 fiscal expansions have been hotly debated. But the discussion of fiscal multipliers is even more relevant now that several European countries have had to quickly retract their stimulus measures in an effort to regain market confidence. Using regime-switching VARs we estimate the impact of fiscal adjustment on the United States, Europe and Japan allowing for fiscal multipliers to vary across recessions and booms. We also estimate ex ante probabilities of recessions derived in association with different-sized and different types of consolidation shocks (expenditure-versus tax-based). We use these estimates to understand how consolidations should be designed to be most effective in terms of permanently and rapidly reducing a country's debt-to-GDP ratio. The main finding is that smooth and gradual consolidations are to be preferred to frontloaded or aggressive consolidations, especially for economies in recession facing high risk premia on public debt, because sheltering growth is key to the success of fiscal consolidation in these cases.},

@article{Baumol1989,
abstract = {Imagine a bargaining model (say, involving diplomats negotiating tariff levels or a disarmament treaty) in which each party has been instructed by higher headquarters to respond to each new offer by her opposite number with a counteroffer that is to be calculated from a simple reaction function provided in advance. Both negotiating parties are prohibited from revealing their own reaction functions to the other. If the perfectly deterministic sequence of offers and counter- offers that must emerge from these simple rules were to begin to oscillate wildly and apparently at random, the negotiations could easily break down as each party, not understanding the source of the problem, came to suspect the other side of duplicity and sabotage. Yet all that may be involved, as we will see, is the phenomenon referred to as chaos, a case that is emphatically not pathological, but in which a dynamic mechanism that is very simple and deterministic yields a time path so complicated that it will pass most standard tests of randomness. Chaos has become a subject of great interest to specialists and nonspecialists alike. Besides economics, it has entered the literature of geometry, physics, ecology and meteorology. It has been written about at length in the New York Times Magazine and Scientific American, as well as technical publications.

abstract = {We analyse the link between income distribution and the current account for the period 1972-2007. We find that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, ceteris paribus. This result is consistent with consumption externalities resulting from upward-looking comparisons. Moreover, an increase in the corporate financial balance or a decrease in the labour income share leads to an increase in the current account. This finding is consistent with the view that consumers do not fully ‘pierce the corporate veil’. Changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances.},

In MAPMOD, bank loans create purchasing power that facilitates adjustments in the real economy. But excessively large and risky loans can impair balance sheets and sow the seeds of a financial crisis. Banks respond to losses through higher spreads and rapid credit cutbacks, with adverse effects for the real economy. These features allow the model to capture the basic facts of financial cycles. A companion paper studies the simulation properties of MAPMOD.},

In addition, the extended rise in U.S. house prices was likely also supported by long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates) that were surprisingly low, given the level of short-term rates and other macro fundamentals—a development that Greenspan (2005) dubbed a “conundrum.” The “global saving glut” (GSG) hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005 and 2007) argues that increased capital inflows to the United States from countries in which desired saving greatly exceeded desired investment—including Asian emerging markets and commodity exporters— were an important reason that U.S. longer-term interest rates during this period were lower than expected.},

We also show how changes in the new monthly data can be decomposed into flows, estimated valuation changes, and a residual "gap". These decompositions can provide a richer and timelier view of developments in both foreign portfolio investment in the U.S. and U.S. portfolio investment abroad than available from transactions data or survey data alone. Data on cross-border holdings through December 2013, by country, are available for download; we also provide advice on how to construct estimates going forward. These data can be combined with the existing Bertaut-Tryon monthly estimates of securities holdings (now updated through 2011) to generate consistent monthly time series of positions.},

abstract = {Relative to the "global savings glut" (GSG) hypothesis, we present a more complete picture of how capital flows contributed to the financial crisis, drawing attention to the sizable inflows from European investors into U.S. private-label asset-backed securities (ABS), including mortgage-backed securities and other structured investment products. The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates. ?? 2012.},

The crisis has encouraged a sharper focus on systemic risk, the inclusion of a financial sector in macroeconomic models, a shift from a microprudential to a macroprudential orientation in regulation and supervision, and questions about whether price stability is a sufficient criterion to guide monetary policy. In the process, it has led to a rediscovery of the macroeconomic roots of financial instability. This paper argues that this development is welcome but has not gone far enough.

abstract = {This essay argues that the Achilles heel of the international monetary and financial system is that it amplifies the “excess financial elasticity” of domestic policy regimes, ie it exacerbates their inability to prevent the build-up of financial imbalances, or outsize financial cycles, that lead to serious financial crises and macroeconomic dislocations. This excess financial elasticity view contrasts sharply with two more popular ones, which stress the failure of the system to prevent disruptive current account imbalances and its tendency to generate a structural shortage of safe assets – the “excess saving” and “excess demand for safe assets” views, respectively. In particular, the excess financial elasticity view highlights financial rather than current account imbalances and a persistent expansionary rather than contractionary bias in the system. The failure to adjust domestic policy regimes and their international interaction raises a number of risks: entrenching instability in the global system; returning to the modern-day equivalent of the divisive competitive devaluations of the interwar years; and, ultimately, triggering an epoch-defining seismic rupture in policy regimes, back to an era of trade and financial protectionism and, possibly, stagnation combined with inflation.},

abstract = {Global current account imbalances have been at the forefront of policy debates over the past few years. Many observers have recently singled them out as a key factor contributing to the global financial crisis. Current account surpluses in several emerging market economies are said to have helped fuel the credit booms and risk-taking in the major advanced deficit countries at the core of the crisis, by putting significant downward pressure on world interest rates and/or by simply financing the booms in those countries (the “excess saving” view). We argue that this perspective on global imbalances bears reconsideration. We highlight two conceptual problems: (i) drawing inferences about a country’s cross-border financing activity based on observations of net capital flows; and (ii) explaining market interest rates through the saving-investment framework. We trace the shortcomings of this perspective to a failure to consider the distinguishing characteristics of a monetary economy. We conjecture that the main contributing factor to the financial crisis was not “excess saving” but the “excess elasticity” of the international monetary and financial system: the monetary and financial regimes in place failed to restrain the build-up of unsustainable credit and asset price booms (“financial imbalances”). Credit creation, a defining feature of a monetary economy, plays a key role in this story.},

abstract = {Over the last decade or so, addressing financial instability has become a policy priority. Despite the efforts made, policymakers are still a long way from developing a satisfactory operational framework. A major challenge complicating this task is the fuzziness with which financial (in)stability can be measured. We review the available measurement methodologies and point out several weaknesses. In particular, we caution against heavy reliance on the current generation of macro stress tests, arguing that they can lull policymakers into a false sense of security. Nonetheless, we argue that the fuzziness in measurement does not prevent further progress towards an operational framework, as long as it is appropriately accounted for. Crucial features of that framework include: strengthening the macroprudential orientation of financial regulation and supervision; addressing more systematically the procyclicality of the financial system; relying as far as possible on automatic stabilisers rather than discretion, thereby lessening the burden on the real-time measurement of financial stability risks; and setting up institutional arrangements that leverage the comparative expertise of the various authorities involved in safeguarding financial stability, not least financial supervisors and central banks.},

abstract = {Since the late-1990s, the global economy is characterised by historically low risk premia and an unprecedented widening of external imbalances. This paper explores to what extent these two global trends can be understood as a reaction to three structural shocks in different regions of the global economy: (i) monetary shocks (“excess liquidity” hypothesis), (ii) preference shocks (“savings glut” hypothesis), and (iii) investment shocks (“investment drought” hypothesis). In order to uniquely identify these shocks in an integrated framework, we estimate structural VARs for the two main regions with widening imbalances, the United States and emerging Asia, using sign restrictions that are compatible with standard New Keynesian and Real Business Cycle models. Our results show that monetary shocks potentially explain the largest part of the variation in imbalances and financial market prices. We find that savings shocks and investment shocks explain less of the variation. Hence, a “liquidity glut” may have been a more important driver of real and financial imbalances in the US and emerging Asia than a “savings glut”.},

To frame the discussion, the author relies on an analysis that emphasizes two possible long-run steady states for the economy: one that is consistent with monetary policy as it has typically been implemented in the United States in recent years and one that is consistent with the low nominal interest rate, deflationary regime observed in Japan during the same period. The data considered seem to be quite consistent with the two steady-state possibilities. The author describes and critiques seven stories that are told in monetary policy circles regarding this analysis and emphasizes two main conclusions: (i) The Federal Open Market Committee's "extended period" language may be increasing the probability of a Japanese-style outcome for the United States and (ii), on balance, the U.S. quantitative easing program offers the best tool to avoid such an outcome.},

abstract = {The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the current stock-flow consistent (SFC) literature. Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos (2006) and, above all, after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie’s Stock-flow Consistent Approach (2007). The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (1) how the models are solved, (2) the treatment of time and its implication, and (3) the need — or not — of microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialization, exchange rate modeling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature, and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) over the possible lines of development of the stock-flow consistent models.},

Second, what are the major types of financial crises? The paper focuses on the main theoretical and empirical explanations of four types of financial crises\^{a}€”currency crises, sudden stops, debt crises, and banking crises\^{a}€”and presents a survey of the literature that attempts to identify these episodes. Third, what are the real and financial sector implications of crises? The paper briefly reviews the short- and medium-run implications of crises for the real economy and financial sector. It concludes with a summary of the main lessons from the literature and future research directions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Cripps2011,
abstract = {This contribution addresses the question of whether growth convergence can be sustained in the global economy without compromising welfare and without causing major crises. It employs a simplified stock-flow analytical framework to examine the proposition that the pace and pattern of global growth is conditioned by 'under-consumption' in some regions of the world and 'over-borrowing' in other regions. A baseline projection using the Cambridge-Alphametrics model (CAM) illustrates consequences of resumed global imbalances after the 2008-2009 crisis. An alternative scenario exemplifies the case in which China and India shift towards internal income redistribution and domestic demand-orientated policies and suggests that this will not be sufficient to correct global imbalances or induce improved growth rates in other developing regions. Finally a more ambitious development perspective is simulated. Such a scenario requires internationally-coordinated policy efforts, with a greater role for governments in the management of demand, income distribution and environmental sustainability, as well as measures to reduce instability of exchange rate and commodity markets.},

It examines first the approaches that regard financial crises as a disturbing factor of a generally stable real economy (Wicksell, Hayek, Schumpeter, Fisher, and the early Keynes). Thereafter, approaches, where the dichotomy between the monetary and the real sphere is lifted are reviewed. Here in particular the later works of Keynes and the contributions of Minsky are of importance. Lastly, it is looked at the behavioural finance approaches. After having reviewed the different approaches it is examined, where those approaches have similarities and where they fruitfully can be combined. Based on this, we develop an own theoretical framework methodologically based on a Wicksellian cumulative process, however, overcoming the neoclassical dichotomy. The paper ends with some policy recommendations based on the developed theoretical framework.},

Because intervention in financial markets is an important part of their development strategy, intervention in exchange and financial markets has, and we argue will continue to be, large and persistent enough to generate predictable deviations of exchange rates and relative yields in industrial country financial markets from normal cyclical patterns. We argue that management of the currency composition of international reserves by emerging market governments and central banks is unlikely to alter these conclusions.},

@article{Dow2012,
abstract = {The economic crisis has exposed shortcomings in standard economic theory and provided an impetus for new economic thinking. But the theoretical debate in the wake of the crisis has been unduly constrained by the terms of the mainstream approach to economic theory. Like any approach, it is characterised by a way of framing reality, giving meaning to terms and setting criteria for good argument. It also determines how any economic theory is understood, whether from the history of economic thought or from the contemporary literature. But there are other approaches to economics which would open up the field to a much wider range of possibilities for new economic thinking. Addressing the challenge that any reader bases her understanding on her own approach, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to explain what it means to consider different approaches and why it matters for policy. This is done by discussing two features of the financial crisis which pose particular problems for economic theory. These are the role of changing market sentiment in driving asset prices on the one hand and the breakdown of trust relationships in banking on the other (the moral hazard issue). We will see how these are addressed by mainstream theory and by alternative approaches. First, market sentiment is discussed within the mainstream rational-optimising framework, where risk is quantifiable, and compared with the Keynesian approach based on the general uncertainty of knowledge, where reason, evidence and sentiment are integrated. The moral hazard issue is then discussed in its mainstream form in terms of rational opportunism and in its institutionalist form in terms of the foundation of social relations (including relations between institutions) in trust. It is shown that different ways of approaching theorising in each case imply different policy measures. It is argued further that an exclusively deductive mathematical approach to analysis of market sentiment and trust is unduly limiting and that a more pluralist approach would more fully address the issues},

abstract = {How did the Subprime Crisis, a problem in a small corner of U.S. financial markets, affect the entire global banking system? To shed light on this questionwe use principal components analysis to iden- tify common factors in the movement of banks’ credit default swap spreads. We find that fortunes of international banks rise and fall togethereveninnormal times alongwithshort-termglobal economic prospects. But the importance of common factors rose steadily to exceptional levels fromtheoutbreak of theSubprimeCrisis topast the rescue of Bear Stearns, reflecting a diffuse sense that funding and credit risk was increasing. Following the failure of Lehman Brothers, the interdependencies briefly increasedto a newhigh, before they fell back to the pre-Lehman elevated levels – but now they more clearly reflected heightened funding and counterparty risk. After Lehman’s failure, the prospect of global recession became imminent, auguring the further deterioration of banks’ loan portfolios. At this point the entire global financial system had become infected},

In the preface, I stated that the results "seem largely new," I spoke thus cautiously because of my unfamiliarity with the vast literature on the subject. Since the book was published its special conclusions have been widely accepted and, so far as I know, no one has yet found them anticipated by previous writers, though several, including myself, have zealously sought to find such anticipations. Two of the best-read authorities in this field assure me that those conclusions are, in the words of one of them, "both new and important." Partly to specify what some of these special conclusions are which are believed to be new and partly to fit them into the conclusions of other students in this field, I am offering this paper as embodying, in brief, my present "creed" on the whole subject of so-called "cycle theory." My "creed" consists of 49 "articles" some of which are old and some new. I say "creed" because, for brevity, it is purposely expressed dogmatically and without proof. But it is not a creed in the sense that my faith in it does not rest on evidence and that I am not ready to modify it on presentation of new evidence. On the contrary, it is quite tentative. It may serve as a challenge to others and as raw material to help them work out a better product. Meanwhile the following is a list of my 49 tentative conclusions.},

Distinguishing among the three main hypotheses ("tradeoff", pecking order, and market timing) requires that we know whether firms have long-run leverage targets and (if so) how quickly they adjust toward them. Yet many previous researchers have applied empirical specifications that fail to recognize the potential for incomplete adjustment. A more general, partial-adjustment model of firm leverage indicates that firms do have target capital structures.

abstract = {Presents preliminary analysis treating expenditure on research and experimental development as investment in an intangible scientific assetThis article presents preliminary analysis treating expenditure on research and experimental development (R\&D) as investment in an intangible scientific asset, in line with ongoing revisions to the UN System of National Accounts. The purpose of this analysis is to communicate to users of statistics the potential impacts of capitalising R\&D in the National Accounts in a new set of satellite accounts. Capitalising R\&D raises the level of UK GDP by approximately 1.5 per cent, but has limited impact on estimates of recent GDP growth. These figures are preliminary, based on experimental methods, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. The author welcomes comments and complementary evidence that can be used to substantiate or revise the assumptions made throughout this article.

abstract = {I show how to use data from the Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States to estimate how much funding of nonfinancial businesses, households, and governments is provided by the domestic shadow banking system. I define the shadow banking system as the set of entities and activities that provide short-term funding outside of the traditional commercial banking system, but I do not equate all nonbank funding with shadow banking. My results suggest that at the end of 2008, domestic shadow-bank funding of the nonfinancial sector was an important, but fairly modest source of funding relative to that provided by more traditional funding sources such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. However,my results suggest that domestic shadow banking played a large role in the increase of nonfinancial-sector debt in the two years before 2008:Q4 and was, at least in an arithmetic sense,the entire reason for the slowdown in nonfinancial-sector debt growth after 2008. Domestic shadow-bank funding of the nonfinancial sector has increased since 2010, but remains well below the level seen right in late 2008.},

The high levels of income inequality resulted in balance of payment imbalances and rising debt levels. Rising wealth concentration contributed to the crisis because the increasing asset demand from the rich enabled poor and middle-income households to accumulate increasing amounts of debt. An important policy implication arising out of this finding is that it is necessary to reverse existing inequality levels to tame the inherent instability of the current mode of capitalism.},

abstract = {This paper integrates the theory of money and credit derived ultimately from Wicksell into the Keynesian theory of income determination, with assets allocated according to Tobinesque principles. The model deployed has much in common with the modern 'endogenous money' school initiated by Kaldor which emphasises the essential role played by credit in any real life economy, since production takes time and the future is always uncertain. New ground is broken methodologically because all the propositions are justified by simulations of a rigorous (60-equation) model, making it possible to pin down exactly why the results come out as they do. One conclusion of the paper is that there is no such thing as a supply of money distinct from the money which agents wish to hold, or find themselves holding. This finding is inimical, possibly in the end lethal, to the way macroeconomics is currently taught as well as to the neoclassical paradigm itself.Keywords:Macroeconomics, Stocks and flows, Inflation accounting, Endogenous money, Banks.},

abstract = {The following paper presents a series of two-country models, each of which makes up a whole world. The models are all based on a rigorous and watertight system of stock and flow accounts and can be used to generate numerical simulations of the way in which of the whole system evolves through time on various assumptions regarding institutions, policies, and behavioral responses. The paper emphasizes that the supply of internationally traded assets is as important as demand in the determination of exchange rates. All the models describe income determination and inflation as well as international trade and intercountry dealings in assets. Apart from deploying a method of analysis believed to be capable of substantial further development, the paper finds that no vestige of the "price-specie flow" mechanism remains once asset demands and supplies are comprehensively represented and inter-related with income flows. It also finds that once the supply of internationally traded assets (for instance, as a result of imbalances in trade) are taken into account, the role of expectations in determining exchange rates—though very important—is exaggerated in much contemporary theorizing.},

abstract = {There are no controlled experiments in macroeconomic policy or systematic programs of microeconomic reform, but a comparison between New Zealand and Australia over the period since 1984 provides as close an approach to such an experiment as is ever likely to be possible. From quite similar starting points, the two countries pursued liberal reform programs that differed sharply, mainly as a result of exogenous differences in constitutional structures and the personal styles of the central actors. Australia followed a more cautious, piecemeal, consensus-based approach, whereas New Zealand adopted a radical, rapid, "purist" platform. The New Zealand reform package was generally seen by contemporary commentators as representing a "textbook" model for best-practice reform. However, Australia since 1984 has performed much better than New Zealand, whose per capita GDP (gross domestic product) growth indeed ranked at or near the bottom of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The article assesses a variety of explanations for the divergences in policies and outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Ito2011,
abstract = {We examine whether the behavior of current account balances changed in the years preceding the global crisis of 2008-09, and assess the prospects for global imbalances in the post-crisis period. Changes in the budget balance are an important factor affecting current account balances for deficit countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. The effect of the “saving glut variables” on current account balances has been relatively stable for emerging market countries, suggesting that those factors cannot explain the bulk of their recent current account movements. We also find the 2006-08 period to constitute a structural break for emerging market countries, and to a lesser extent, for industrialized countries. We attribute the anomalous behavior of pre-crisis current account balances to stock market performance and real housing appreciation; fiscal procyclicality and the stance of monetary policy do not matter as much. Household leverage also appears to explain some of the standard model’s prediction errors. Looking forward, U.S., fiscal consolidation alone cannot induce significant deficit reduction. For China, financial development might help shrink its current account surplus, but only when it is coupled with financial liberalization. These findings suggest that unless countries implement substantially more policy change, global imbalances are unlikely to disappear.},

@article{Kahneman1979,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling},

If the Government undertakes public investment (e.g. builds schools, hospitals, and highways) or subsidises mass consumption (by family allowances, reduction of indirect taxation, or subsidies to keep down the prices of necessities), if, moreover, this expenditure is financed by borrowing and not by taxation (which could affect adversely private investment 2nd consumption), the effective demand for goods and services may be increased up to a point where full employment is achieved. Such Government expenditure increases employment, be it noted, not only directly but indirectly as well, since the higher incomes caused by it result in a secondary increase in demand for consumption and jnvestment goods. 2.-lt may be asked where the public will get the money to lend to the Government if they do not curtail their investment and consumption. To understand this process it is best, I think, to imagine for a moment that the Government pays its suppliers in Government securities. The suppliers will, in general, not retain these securities but put them into circulation uhile buying other goods and services, and so on until finally these securities will reach persons or firms which retain them as interest-yielding assets. In any period of time the total increase in Government securities in the possession (transitory or final) of persons and firms will be equal to the goods and},

abstract = {John Maynard Keynes Is The Great British Economist Of The Twentieth Century Whose Hugely Influential Work The General Theory Of Employment, Interest And Money Is Undoubtedly The Century S Most Important Book On Economics Strongly Influencing Economic Theory And Practice, Particularly With Regard To The Role Of Government In Stimulating And Regulating A Nation S Economic Life. Keynes S Work Has Undergone Significant Revaluation In Recent Years, And Keynesian Views Which Have Been Widely Defended For So Long Are Now Perceived As At Odds With Keynes S Own Thinking. Recent Scholarship And Research Has Demonstrated Considerable Rivalry And Controversy Concerning The Proper Interpretation Of Keynes S Works, Such That Recourse To The Original Text Is All The More Important. Although Considered By A Few Critics That The Sentence Structures Of The Book Are Quite Incomprehensible And Almost Unbearable To Read, The Book Is An Essential Reading For All Those Who Desire A Basic Education In Economics. The Key To Understanding Keynes Is The Notion That At Particular Times In The Business Cycle, An Economy Can Become Over-Productive (Or Under-Consumptive) And Thus, A Vicious Spiral Is Begun That Results In Massive Layoffs And Cuts In Production As Businesses Attempt To Equilibrate Aggregate Supply And Demand. Thus, Full Employment Is Only One Of Many Or Multiple Macro Equilibria. If An Economy Reaches An Underemployment Equilibrium, Something Is Necessary To Boost Or Stimulate Demand To Produce Full Employment. This Something Could Be Business Investment But Because Of The Logic And Individualist Nature Of Investment Decisions, It Is Unlikely To Rapidly Restore Full Employment. Keynes Logically Seizes Upon The Public Budget And Government Expenditures As The Quickest Way To Restore Full Employment. Borrowing The Money To Finance The Deficit From Private Households And Businesses Is A Quick, Direct Way To Restore Full Employment While At The Same Time, Redirecting Or Siphoning Off The Funds From The Private Sector Which Caused The Over-Production Is In The First Place. Keynes S Theory Is Unquestionably Significant In Understanding Of Modern Economics. Far From Being Destructive, It Alone Has Been Responsible For Nearly 60 Years Of Growth Without A Major Depression As We Experienced Worldwide In The 1930S.While The Present Book Is Indispensable For The Students, Researchers And Teachers Of Economics, It Is Highly Useful For The General Readers Keenly Interested In Understanding Nation S Economy.},

abstract = {The crisis has exposed the failure of economic models to deal sensibly with endogenously generated crises propagating from the financial sectors to the real economy, and back again. The goal of this paper is to review the method of stock flow consistent modeling to highlight areas in which it is deficient. I argue there is a fruitful research agenda in shoring up these deficiencies. The objective of stock flow modeling should be the ability to practically model unstable macroeconomies, and in particular their interactions with the financial sector. These models should provide 'Words to the Wise', and until they do, they are just thought experiments.},

@article{Kirman2010,
abstract = {This article examines, in the light of recent events, the origins of the difficulties that current macroeconomic models have in encompassing the sort of sudden crisis which we are currently observing. The reasons for this are partly due to fundamental problems with the underlying General Equilibrium theory and partly to the unrealistic assumptions on which most financial models are based. What is common to the two is that systematic warnings over more than a century in the case of finance and over 30 years in the case of equilibrium theory have been ignored and we have persisted with models which are both unsound theoretically and incompatible with the data. It is suggested that we drop the unrealistic individual basis for aggregate behaviour and the even more unreasonable assumption that the aggregate behaves like such a ‘rational’ individual. We should rather analyse the economy as a complex adaptive system, and take the network structure that governs interaction into account. Models that do this, of which two examples are given, unlike standard macroeconomic models, may at least enable us to envisage major ‘phase transitions’ in the economy even if we are unlikely to be able to forecast the timing of their onset.

abstract = {Should politicians turn to business leaders for advice in formulating economic policy? Not according to economist Paul Krugman, who argues that executives' advice is often disastrously misguided. The arguments that economists know to be true seem counterintuitive to business people, For example, executives agree that free trade will result in more exports and therefore more export-related jobs. Economists know, however, that, workers who gain jobs from increased exports must gain them at someone else's expense. And businesspeople believe that a country that attracts foreign investment will run a trade surplus, but economists know that such a country will necessarily run large deficits. It's not that economists are smarter than businesspeople. They simply think a different way. Economists deal with the the closed system of a national economy whereas executives live in ,the open-system world of business. Moreover, economists know that an economy must be run on the basis of general principles, but businesspeople are forever in search of the particular brilliant strategy. Business leaders who have been promoted to economic advisers are no more likely to be great economists than military experts. People who have mastered the complexities of running a multibillion-dollar enterprise may think they can make pronouncements whenever the subject is money, but before they can offer sound economic advice, they must master a new vocabulary and a new set of concepts. In short, they must go back to school.},

abstract = {The thesis of the paper is that macroeconomics in the original sense has succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades. This paper reviews the theory and evidence leading to this conclusion. The general logic of quantitative welfare analysis, in which policy comparisons are reduced to difference perceived and valued by individuals, is outlined. The paper provides a brief review of some examples of changes in long-run monetary and fiscal policies that consumers would view as equivalent to increases of 5-15\% in the overall consumption levels.},

Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions--banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they "multiply up" central bank money to create new loans and deposits. The amount of money created in the economy ultimately depends on the monetary policy of the central bank. In normal times, this is carried out by setting interest rates. The central bank can also affect the amount of money directly through purchasing assets or "quantitative easing."},

We characterize shadow banking as “money market funding of capital market lending” and construct a model of such a system with dealers making markets and setting prices for funding and risk. Using this model, we describe the secular expansion of the market-based credit system and its rapid collapse during the global financial crisis. The model also clarifies the economic functions of the market-based credit system, the role of the central bank in such a system, and the global character of US dollar funding markets.},

abstract = {Walter Bagehot's Lombard Street, published in 1873 in the wake of a devastating London bank collapse, explained in clear and straightforward terms why central banks must serve as the lender of last resort to ensure liquidity in a faltering credit system. Bagehot's book set down the principles that helped define the role of modern central banks, particularly in times of crisis--but the recent global financial meltdown has posed unforeseen challenges. The New Lombard Street lays out the innovative principles needed to address the instability of today's markets and to rebuild our financial system. Revealing how we arrived at the current crisis, Perry Mehrling traces the evolution of ideas and institutions in the American banking system since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913. He explains how the Fed took classic central banking wisdom from Britain and Europe and adapted it to America's unique and considerably more volatile financial conditions. Mehrling demonstrates how the Fed increasingly found itself serving as the dealer of last resort to ensure the liquidity of securities markets--most dramatically amid the recent financial crisis. Now, as fallout from the crisis forces the Fed to adapt in unprecedented ways, new principles are needed to guide it. In The New Lombard Street, Mehrling persuasively argues for a return to the classic central bankers' "money view," which looks to the money market to assess risk and restore faith in our financial system.},

Despite this their history is not available in the literature, their theoretical grounding is never explained, and the mechanics of the models remain hidden under layers of rhetoric, myths and hand gestures at various theoretical structures. Therefore, this paper explains what CGE models are, how they work, and where they came from. It will be shown that CGE models have always been and are macroeconomic models, and not based on general equilibrium theory. In doing so, it will detail how Walras’s general equilibrium is not equivalent to Arrow-Debreu’s General Equilibrium, and that CGE models use neither of those frameworks. Furthermore, this paper gives the history of the model and identifies its (relatively) few key variables, in order to explain how model builders construct CGE models, and consciously impose causality, while choosing exogenous variables that define results. CGE models can be a very useful policy tool, but only by understanding that it is a static fixed output model, not built for dynamic analysis along the lines of Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium. With this paper in hand, users will be able to know which questions to ask model builders, to ensure more transparency and clarity in future CGE models.},

abstract = {This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.},

In light of the rapid growth of gross global financial flows and the serious risks associated with them, one might wonder about the continuing relevance of the net financial flow measured by the current account balance. I argue that global current account imbalances remain an essential target for policy scrutiny, for financial as well as macroeconomic reasons. Nonetheless, it is critically important for policymakers to monitor as well the rapidly evolving structure of global gross assets and liabilities.},

abstract = {In contrast to conventional, disaggregative testing of the law of one price, a study is conducted that adopts an aggregative approach. The premise of the study is that the reason for the failure of the law of one price in empirical testing is the disaggregative approach almost uniformly followed. First, an equation is developed involving purchasing power parity, the exchange rate, and the nontradable/tradable price ratio in each country. Next, this relationship is used to form 2 tests of the law of one price: 1. equality of the prices of tradables and nontradables for a given country, and 2. equality of the price of tradables across countries. Tests for the validity of the aggregative approach are described as well. The disaggregative approach shows biases that lead to rejection of the law of one price. In contrast, the results of the aggregative method for the law of one price are strongly positive, and the limitations of the approach are found not to overcome its findings.},

After discussing$\backslash$nthe shortcomings of the original version of their model as an analytical$\backslash$nframework for emerging economies, we will present a more general and$\backslash$nrelevant model that (1) has a broader list of assets (nine assets) than$\backslash$nthe original model (three assets); (2) assumes the existence of trade$\backslash$nbetween the domestic economy and the rest of the world in order to$\backslash$nintroduce the crucial variable for our analysis-the real exchange rate;$\backslash$nand (3) has high (although imperfect) capital mobility-in the sense of$\backslash$nMundell and Fleming-so that interest rate differential is a major factor$\backslash$ndetermining capital inflows to emerging countries.},

abstract = {Financialization is a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes. Financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the macro and micro levels. Its principal impacts are to (1) elevate the significance of the financial sector relative to the real sector, (2) transfer income from the real sector to the financial sector, and (3) increase income inequality and contribute to wage stagnation. Additionally, there are reasons to believe that financialization may put the economy at risk of debt deflation and prolonged recession. Financialization operates through three different conduits: changes in the structure and operation of financial markets, changes in the behavior of nonfinancial corporations, and changes in economic policy. Countering financialization calls for a multifaceted agenda that (1) restores policy control over financial markets, (2) challenges the neoliberal economic policy paradigm encouraged by financialization, (3) makes corporations responsive to interests of stakeholders other than just financial markets, and (4) reforms the political process so as to diminish the influence of corporations and wealthy elites.},

@article{Palley2013,
abstract = {This paper argues the euro zone crisis is the product of a toxic neoliberal economic policy cock- tail. The mixing of that cocktail traces all the way back to the early 1980s when Europe embraced the neoliberal economic model that undermined the income and demand generation process via wage stagnation and widened income inequality. Stagnation was serially postponed by a number of developments, including the stimulus from German re-unification and the low interest rate con- vergence produced by creation of the euro. The latter prompted a ten year credit and asset price bubble that created fictitious prosperity. Postponing stagnation in this fashion has had costs because it worsened the ultimate stagnation by creating large build-ups of debt. Additionally, the creation of the euro ensconced a flawed monetary system that fosters public debt crisis and the political economy of fiscal austerity. Lastly, during this period of postponement, Germany sought to avoid stagnation via export-led growth based on wage repression. That has created an internal balance of payments problem within the euro zone that is a further impediment to resolving the crisis. There is a way out of the crisis. It requires replacing the neoliberal economic model with a structu- ral Keynesian model; remaking the European Central Bank so that it acts as government banker; having Germany replace its export-led growth wage suppression model with a domestic demand- led growth model; and creating a pan-European model of wage and fiscal policy coordination that blocks race to the bottom tendencies within Europe. Countries, particularly Germany, can implement some of this agenda on their own. However, much of the agenda must be implemented collectively, which makes change enormously difficult. Moreover, the war of ideas in favor of such reforms has yet to be won. Consequently, both politics and the ruling intellectual climate make success unlikely and augur a troubled future.},

Within the market-based financial system, “shadow banks” have served a critical role. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that con- duct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without explicit access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, limited-purpose finance companies (LPFCs), and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

abstract = {The term paper focuses on the genesis of ideas of nonlinearity, stochasticity, and dynamics in economic thought as a series of intellec- tual advances that connected the linear static (quasi-dynamical) deter- minism of the 18th-19th centuries with the linear mechanistic systems with stochastic terms and the nonlinear deterministic and stochastic dynamical models of the late 20th century, specifically, the chaos the- ory. The emphasis is placed on the developments of the second half of the 20th century. Technicalities are avoided.},

Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. “Each person,” writes Rawls, “possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.” Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls’s theory is as powerful today as it was when first published.},

abstract = {The shadow banking system can broadly be described as credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system. Intermediating credit through nonbank channels can have important advantages and contributes to the financing of the real economy, but such channels can also become a source of systemic risk, especially when they are structured to perform bank-like functions (e.g. maturity transformation and leverage) and when their interconnectedness with the regular banking system is strong. Therefore, appropriate monitoring of shadow banking helps to mitigate the build-up of such systemic risks. The FSB set out its approach for monitoring the global shadow banking system in its report to the G20 in October 2011. 2 This report presents the results of the third annual monitoring exercise following this approach, using end-2012 data. The report includes data from 25 jurisdictions and the euro area as a whole, bringing the coverage of the monitoring exercise to about 80\% of global GDP and 90\% of global financial system assets.5 As in previous exercises, the primary focus of the monitoring is a ‘macro-mapping’ based on national Flow of Funds and Sector Balance Sheet data (hereafter Flow of Funds), that looks at all non-bank financial intermediation6 to provide a conservative estimate which ensures that data gathering and surveillance cover the areas where shadow banking-related risks to the financial system might potentially arise.7 Sections 2 to 4 and Section 6 of the report present the result of the macro-mapping, including size and growth trends of the shadow banking system, cross-jurisdiction analysis, trends in sub-sectors and interconnectedness with the banking system.},

The first part of the paper offers a novel theory to explain this phenomenon. Financialisation, the shareholder revolution and the development of a market for corporate control have shifted power to shareholders and thus changed management priorities, leading to a reduction in the desired growth rate. In the second part, the link between accumulation and financialisation is tested econometrically by means of a time series analysis of aggregate business investment for the USA, the UK, France and Germany. Extensive tests of robustness are performed. For the first three countries, evidence supporting the negative effect of financialisation on accumulation is found.},

The core difference that the Robinsonian model assumes full capacity utilization in the long run, while the Kaleckian model has capacity utilization as an endogenous variable. The characteristics of these models and in particular the effects of changes in the savings propensity and the relation between distribution and growth are highlighted and contrasted.

@article{Stockhammer2011,
abstract = {According to the mainstream view, labour market institutions (LMIs) are the key determinants of unemployment in the medium run. The actual empirical explanatory power of measures for labour market institutions, however, has recently been called into question. The Keynesian view holds periods of high real interest rates and insufficient capital accumulation responsible for unemployment. Empirical work in this tradition has paid little attention to the role of LMIs. This paper contributes to the debate by highlighting the role of autonomous changes in capital accumulation as a macroeconomic shock. In the empirical analysis, medium-term unemployment is explained by capital accumulation, LMIs and a number of macroeconomic shocks in a panel analysis covering 20 OECD countries. The economic effects of changes in LMI, variations in capital accumulation and other macro shocks are compared. Capital accumulation and the real interest rate are found to have statistically significant effects that are robust to the inclusion of control variables and show larger effects than LMI.

abstract = {In order to mitigate climate change, deep reductions in CO2 emissions will be required in the coming decades. Carbon capture and storage will likely play an important role in these reductions. As a compli- ment to capturing CO2 from point sources, CO2 can be captured from ambient air (“air capture”), offsetting emissions from distributed sources or reducing atmospheric concentrations when emissions have already been constrained. In this thesis, we show that CO2 capture from air is physically and thermodynamically feasible, discuss the various routes available, and explain why NaOH solution is a viable sorbent for large- scale capture. An example system using NaOH spray is presented. With experimental data and a variety of numerical techniques, the use of NaOH spray for air capture is assessed and an example contacting system developed. The cost and energy requirements of the example contacting system are estimated. Contactor estimates are combined with estimates from industry and other research to estimate the cost of a complete air capture system. We ﬁnd that the cost of capturing CO2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 \$/t-CO2, and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper-bound cost to 130 \$/t-CO2. Even at the high calculated cost, air capture has implications for climate policy, however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower-cost systems.},

abstract = {No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.\^{a}\^{A} \^{a}H. L. Mencken\^{A} H. L. Mencken was wrong.In this endlessly fascinating book, New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea that has profound implications:\^{A} large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant\^{a}better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.This seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate, how knowledge is advanced, how economies are (or should be) organized and how we live our daily lives. With seemingly boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose, Surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture, psychology, ant biology, economic behaviorism, artificial intelligence, military history and political theory to show just how this principle operates in the real world.\^{A} Despite the sophistication of his arguments, Surowiecki presents them in a wonderfully entertaining manner. The examples he uses are all down-to-earth, surprising, and fun to ponder. Why is the line in which you\^{a}re standing always the longest? Why is it that you can buy a screw anywhere in the world and it will fit a bolt bought ten-thousand miles away? Why is network television so awful? If you had to meet someone in Paris on a specific day but had no way of contacting them, when and where would you meet? Why are there traffic jams? What\^{a}s the best way to win money on a game show? Why, when you walk into a convenience store at 2:00 A.M. to buy a quart of orange juice, is it there waiting for you? What do Hollywood mafia movies have to teach us about why corporations exist?The Wisdom of Crowds is a brilliant but accessible biography of an idea, one with important lessons for how we live our lives, select our leaders, conduct our business, and think about our world.},

abstract = {Headline findings 1. There is currently a window of opportunity to put the UK economy decisively on a trajectory towards low-carbon prosperity, resource security and environmental quality: interest rates are low and, with still under-utilised resources, the benefits of stimulating directed investment can be large. 2. A green economy strategy can strengthen the UK economy by addressing major long- term weaknesses, particularly under-investment in infrastructure and under-performance in innovation. A credible, long-term strategy, supported by environmental tax reform, can thus deliver a more soundly-based recovery, economically as well as environmentally. 3. Government should take a more proactive, strategic approach to driving green innovation. A green industrial strategy can help to strengthen the UK innovation system and secure comparative advantage in key sectors and areas of technology that enhance resource productivity, but global competition in these areas is intensifying. 4. Government should adopt a clearer approach to prioritisation of key infrastructure projects, and ensure that infrastructure investments are compatible with long-term green economy objectives. Going beyond the undifferentiated infrastructure list in the UK Infrastructure Plan, the Government needs to identify what green infrastructure investments are required and prioritise these accordingly in order to ensure policy clarity and credibility. 5. A new information infrastructure is required to facilitate the evolution of a greener economy. Current national accounting practices and corporate reporting rules were largely developed at a time when the economic and social importance of environment and resource issues was less well recognised than it is today. Government should develop comprehensive natural capital and material flow accounts for the UK economy.},

abstract = {This paper constructs the aggregated and compact disaggregated financial social accounting matrices for Pakistan for the year 1999/2000. The extension of the SAM on financial side and inclusion of information on flow of funds is an important contribution of this study to the existing literature on social accounting matrices. A number of key characteristics of the real and financial sides of the economy are derived from the direct inspection of the financial social accounting matrices for Pakistan. The estimates of the SAM show a high share of agriculture sector in capital income, which is a reflection of land ownership structure in Pakistan. Similarly, there is a low share of wages in total factor income, which reflect that most of the workers in Pakistan are self employed and their income is recorded as capital income. The estimates of goods for domestic and export markets show that bulk of the gross domestic product was consumed domestically and only 16 percent was exported to the world market in the year 1999/2000. Furthermore, 58 percent of the total physical investment was made by the government and the contribution of non-financial firms in total physical investment was only 13 percent. During the same period the non-financial firms reduced their borrowing from the banking system which reflect uncomfortable environment for business activities in the year 1999/2000. A low share of non-financial firms in total physical investment and reduced borrowing of private firms reflect weak investors' confidence, which requires special attention of the policy makers in Pakistan.},

While the dramatic reductions in both long-term inflation expectations and the volatility of long rates contributed much to the decline of long rates in the 1990s, more recently foreign flows have become important. Controlling for various factors, we estimate that absent the substantial foreign inflows into U.S. government bonds the 10-year Treasury yield would be 80 basis points higher.

The apparent velocity decline in the quantity equation and the resulting instability of the money demand function; 2. unusually fast rises in asset prices that often came to be referred to as speculative bubbles and which could not be explained by standard asset pricing models; and 3. capital exports from Japan, which reached historic proportions in the mid-1980s, but collapsed in the early 1990s, and which could not be explained by traditional models. In this article I present a simple model that encompasses the standard theory as a special case and which simultaneously can account for the above three 'anomalies'. It is based on a 'quantity equation' of credit creation, which is disaggregated into credit for 'financial circulation' and credit for the 'real circulation'. It is shown that excessive credit creation for financial circulation is responsible for all three 'anomalies'. The model is supported in empirical tests using the general to specific econometric methodology and using Japanese data. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for monetary theory, future research and economic policy.},

abstract = {While macroeconomics is often thought of as a deeply divided field, with less of a shared core and correspondingly less cumulative progress than other areas of economics, in fact, there are fewer fundamental disagreements among macroeconomists now than in past decades. This is due to important progress in resolving seemingly intractable debates. In this paper, I review some of those debates and outline important elements of the new synthesis in macroeconomic theory. I discusses the extent to which the new developments in theory and research methods are already affecting macroeconomic analysis in policy institutions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper applies Hyman Minskys approach to provide an analysis of the causes of the global financial crisis. Rather than finding the origins in recent developments, this paper links the crisis to the long-term transformation of the economy from a robust financial structure in the 1950s to the fragile one that existed at the beginning of this crisis in 2007. As Minsky said, Stability is destabilizing: the relative stability of the economy in the early postwar period encouraged this transformation of the economy. Todays crisis is rooted in what he called money manager capitalism, the current stage of capitalism dominated by highly leveraged funds seeking maximum returns in an environment that systematically under-prices risk. With little regulation or supervision of financial institutions, money managers have concocted increasingly esoteric instruments that quickly spread around the world. Those playing along are rewarded with high returns because highly leveraged funding drives up prices for the underlying assets. Since each subsequent bust wipes out only a portion of the managed money, a new boom inevitably rises. Perhaps this will prove to be the end of this stage of capitalism the money manager phase. Of course, it is too early even to speculate on the form capitalism will take. I will only briefly outline some policy implications.},

Compared with consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI), the price index of traded-goods (TPI) appears to be a more appropriate price index for both PPP tests and exchange rate forecasting. It performs better in the tests and provides superior exchange rate forecasts, both within- and out-of-sample. While the half-life of the estimated deviations from PPP is about two years for the CPI and WPI-based real exchange rates, it is only one year for the TPI-based real exchange rates.},
