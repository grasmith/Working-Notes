@article{Fisher1933,
abstract = {IN Booms and Depressions, I have developed, theoretically and statistically, what may be called a debt-deflation theory of great depressions. In the preface, I stated that the results "seem largely new," I spoke thus cautiously because of my unfamiliarity with the vast literature on the subject. Since the book was published its special conclusions have been widely accepted and, so far as I know, no one has yet found them anticipated by previous writers, though several, including myself, have zealously sought to find such anticipations. Two of the best-read authorities in this field assure me that those conclusions are, in the words of one of them, "both new and important." Partly to specify what some of these special conclusions are which are believed to be new and partly to fit them into the conclusions of other students in this field, I am offering this paper as embodying, in brief, my present "creed" on the whole subject of so-called "cycle theory." My "creed" consists of 49 "articles" some of which are old and some new. I say "creed" because, for brevity, it is purposely expressed dogmatically and without proof. But it is not a creed in the sense that my faith in it does not rest on evidence and that I am not ready to modify it on presentation of new evidence. On the contrary, it is quite tentative. It may serve as a challenge to others and as raw material to help them work out a better product. Meanwhile the following is a list of my 49 tentative conclusions.},

abstract = {I SOLID majority of economists is now of the opinion that, even in a capitalist system, full employ-ment may be secured by a Government spending programme, provided there is in existence adequate provided adequate supplies of necessary foreign raw materials m3y be obtained in exchange for exports. If the Government undertakes public investment (e.g. builds schools, hospitals, and highways) or subsidises mass consumption (by family allowances, reduction of indirect taxation, or subsidies to keep down the prices of necessities), if, moreover, this expenditure is financed by borrowing and not by taxation (which could affect adversely private investment 2nd consumption), the effective demand for goods and services may be increased up to a point where full employment is achieved. Such Government expenditure increases employment, be it noted, not only directly but indirectly as well, since the higher incomes caused by it result in a secondary increase in demand for consumption and jnvestment goods. 2.-lt may be asked where the public will get the money to lend to the Government if they do not curtail their investment and consumption. To understand this process it is best, I think, to imagine for a moment that the Government pays its suppliers in Government securities. The suppliers will, in general, not retain these securities but put them into circulation uhile buying other goods and services, and so on until finally these securities will reach persons or firms which retain them as interest-yielding assets. In any period of time the total increase in Government securities in the possession (transitory or final) of persons and firms will be equal to the goods and},

Both the Iran and Sri Lanka SAMs were constructed within the context of the International Labour Office, World Employment Programme: that for Iran was intended as a contribution to the work of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Mission to Iran under WEP auspices; while the Sri Lanka SAM was more specifically a research oriented study. The Swaziland study was financed by the Overseas Development Ministry, London as a research activity.

abstract = {Core argument: if you go to far away from being realistic then the theory becomes not such a useful theory (counter-Friedman. Evidence that abstract theory makes good prediction is pretty weak). A sophisticated concept of behavior ought to accommodate alternative explanations of behavior and allow for non-selfish behavior. Critical of assumption that every person is always motivated only by self interest. The way economists have made egoism a definitional matter, they argue you can always interpret behavior as self seeking because you always behave according to your preferences and therefore you are self seeking. (Granovetter commentary: 2 reasons we want to avoid the argument that all human beings are selfish. 1) You have to think about the explanations of theory and the explanations only serve you well when they help you make distinctions. In pragmatic terms, defining all behavior as selfish empties the definition of selfishness of meaning. Becomes so broad that you lose the possibility of non-selfish behavior and altruism. It might be rare that people are truly altruistic but even if it is rare you need to think about the determinants of that.) Sen distinguishes between sympathy and commitment. 1) sympathyseeing the torture makes you stop it (could be interpreted as selfish action), 2) commitmenttorture doesnt make you sick but you feel it is wrong and therefore you stop it (not selfish behavior). Therefore, by commitment, Sen suggests that people might be motivated by more than just their pleasure or pain. Furthermore, Sen argues we should talk about meta-preferences (preferences about preferences). Even though we might act one way we might wish we acted differently. Might wish we ate less, smoked less, etc than we did. Sen suggests that these metapreferences may affect behavior and choices. Extension: Some economists talk about multiple selves. Thomas Schell, Self and Consequence. Argues that our current self takes actions to restrain our future self that we wish it wouldnt. Ex: setting alarm but know you will just hit snooze therefore put it on other side of room (present self restraining future self). Other examples: Ulysesses and sirens, addiction. A lot of interesting complexities about subjective states and selfish/unselfish behavior.},

abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains.

Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.},

The premise of the study is that the reason for the failure of the law of one price in empirical testing is the disaggregative approach almost uniformly followed. First, an equation is developed involving purchasing power parity, the exchange rate, and the nontradable/tradable price ratio in each country. Next, this relationship is used to form 2 tests of the law of one price: 1. equality of the prices of tradables and nontradables for a given country, and 2. equality of the price of tradables across countries. Tests for the validity of the aggregative approach are described as well. The disaggregative approach shows biases that lead to rejection of the law of one price. In contrast, the results of the aggregative method for the law of one price are strongly positive, and the limitations of the approach are found not to overcome its findings.},

abstract = {Imagine a bargaining model (say, involving diplomats negotiating tariff levels or a disarmament treaty) in which each party has been instructed by higher headquarters to respond to each new offer by her opposite number with a counteroffer that is to be calculated from a simple reaction function provided in advance. Both negotiating parties are prohibited from revealing their own reaction functions to the other. If the perfectly deterministic sequence of offers and counter- offers that must emerge from these simple rules were to begin to oscillate wildly and apparently at random, the negotiations could easily break down as each party, not understanding the source of the problem, came to suspect the other side of duplicity and sabotage. Yet all that may be involved, as we will see, is the phenomenon referred to as chaos, a case that is emphatically not pathological, but in which a dynamic mechanism that is very simple and deterministic yields a time path so complicated that it will pass most standard tests of randomness. Chaos has become a subject of great interest to specialists and nonspecialists alike. Besides economics, it has entered the literature of geometry, physics, ecology and meteorology. It has been written about at length in the New York Times Magazine and Scientific American, as well as technical publications. This article seeks to describe what it is, how it works, and what it means for economics},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The theory proposed is a simple one, but aims to grasp essential features of the industrial economies. Economists have long known that two basic phenomena lie at the root of long-term economic movements in industrial societies: capital accumulation and technical progress, but attention has generally been concentrated on the former. In this book, by contrast, technical progress is assigned the central role. Within a multi-sector framework, the author examines the structural dynamics of prices, production, and employment (implied by differentiated rates of productivity growth and of expansion of demand) against a background of 'natural' relations. He also considers a number of problems that arise at the institutional level. Individuals' and social learning, know-how, and the diffusion of knowledge emerge as the decisive factors accounting for the success and failure of industrial societies.},

The empirical analysis estimates a long-run relationship between the real exchange rate, net foreign assets and other factors affecting trade flows. Using postwar data for the United States and Japan, cointegration analysis supports the finding that the structural factors underlying each country`s net trade and net foreign asset positions determine the long-run path for the real value of the dollar and the yen. The empirical analysis also provides estimates for the underlying stochastic trend in each real exchange rate series.},

The authors document the responses of GDP and its components to monetary policy shocks and describe how the credit channel helps explain the facts. They discuss two main components of this mechanism, the balance sheet and bank lending channels. The authors argue that forecasting exercises using credit aggregates are not valid tests of this theory.},

abstract = {Should politicians turn to business leaders for advice in formulating economic policy? Not according to economist Paul Krugman, who argues that executives' advice is often disastrously misguided. The arguments that economists know to be true seem counterintuitive to business people, For example, executives agree that free trade will result in more exports and therefore more export-related jobs. Economists know, however, that, workers who gain jobs from increased exports must gain them at someone else's expense. And businesspeople believe that a country that attracts foreign investment will run a trade surplus, but economists know that such a country will necessarily run large deficits. It's not that economists are smarter than businesspeople. They simply think a different way. Economists deal with the the closed system of a national economy whereas executives live in ,the open-system world of business. Moreover, economists know that an economy must be run on the basis of general principles, but businesspeople are forever in search of the particular brilliant strategy. Business leaders who have been promoted to economic advisers are no more likely to be great economists than military experts. People who have mastered the complexities of running a multibillion-dollar enterprise may think they can make pronouncements whenever the subject is money, but before they can offer sound economic advice, they must master a new vocabulary and a new set of concepts. In short, they must go back to school.},

@article{Werner1997,
abstract = {During the course of the 1980s three major 'anomalies' were observed in a number of countries, including in Japan, which threw doubt on the traditional macroeconomic models: 1. The apparent velocity decline in the quantity equation and the resulting instability of the money demand function; 2. unusually fast rises in asset prices that often came to be referred to as speculative bubbles and which could not be explained by standard asset pricing models; and 3. capital exports from Japan, which reached historic proportions in the mid-1980s, but collapsed in the early 1990s, and which could not be explained by traditional models. In this article I present a simple model that encompasses the standard theory as a special case and which simultaneously can account for the above three 'anomalies'. It is based on a 'quantity equation' of credit creation, which is disaggregated into credit for 'financial circulation' and credit for the 'real circulation'. It is shown that excessive credit creation for financial circulation is responsible for all three 'anomalies'. The model is supported in empirical tests using the general to specific econometric methodology and using Japanese data. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for monetary theory, future research and economic policy.},

This process requires savers, investors and intermediaries to value the prospective profit of particular investments in historically unique circumstances. Contemporary economic methodology, on the other hand, sees statistically re- peatable observed events as the operational equivalents of the abstract variables of mathematical models of economic behavior. The attempts of Minsky and his followers to express his vision in the language of mathematical and economet- ric modeling founder on the incompatibility of these two points of view. The inescapable relevance of Minsky’s ideas to the understanding of world political economic developments challenges us to expand received notions of scientific method applied to economics and economic data.},

abstract = {The following paper presents a series of two-country models, each of which makes up a whole world. The models are all based on a rigorous and watertight system of stock and flow accounts and can be used to generate numerical simulations of the way in which of the whole system evolves through time on various assumptions regarding institutions, policies, and behavioral responses. The paper emphasizes that the supply of internationally traded assets is as important as demand in the determination of exchange rates. All the models describe income determination and inflation as well as international trade and intercountry dealings in assets. Apart from deploying a method of analysis believed to be capable of substantial further development, the paper finds that no vestige of the "price-specie flow" mechanism remains once asset demands and supplies are comprehensively represented and inter-related with income flows. It also finds that once the supply of internationally traded assets (for instance, as a result of imbalances in trade) are taken into account, the role of expectations in determining exchange rates—though very important—is exaggerated in much contemporary theorizing.},

abstract = {This paper integrates the theory of money and credit derived ultimately from Wicksell into the Keynesian theory of income determination, with assets allocated according to Tobinesque principles. The model deployed has much in common with the modern 'endogenous money' school initiated by Kaldor which emphasises the essential role played by credit in any real life economy, since production takes time and the future is always uncertain. New ground is broken methodologically because all the propositions are justified by simulations of a rigorous (60-equation) model, making it possible to pin down exactly why the results come out as they do. One conclusion of the paper is that there is no such thing as a supply of money distinct from the money which agents wish to hold, or find themselves holding. This finding is inimical, possibly in the end lethal, to the way macroeconomics is currently taught as well as to the neoclassical paradigm itself.Keywords:Macroeconomics, Stocks and flows, Inflation accounting, Endogenous money, Banks.},

Each recalled the most recent dispute they had encountered either between two subordinates or between a subordinate and a person outside the group (i.e., an outsider).Subsequently, they reported the techniques used to mange the dispute. As predicted, the leaders were more assertive in managing subordinate-subordinate conflicts. Unexpectedly, they also pressed their own subordinates quite forcefully in the subordinate-outsider disputes. The second study investigated subordinates' interventions in their leaders' disputes. In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to discuss and analyse how the balance of payments impinges on the growth performance of countries. This is important because mainstream growth theory still largely ignores the balance of payments. In classical growth theory, the balance of payments was assumed to look after itself through internal or external price adjustment, thereby severing any possible link between the state of the balance of payments and the use or accumulation of resources for economic growth. Harrod’s growth model (Harrod 1939) was a closed economy model, and so was the neoclassical growth model (see, for example, Solow 1956) with the added objection that the demand side of the economy was completely ignored. Savings determine investment and aggregate demand equals aggregate supply. ‘New’ growth theory, or endogenous growth theory (see Romer 1986; Lucas 1988) is also supply orientated and there are no demand constraints either internal or external. Many of the ‘new’ growth models are closed economy models, and in those which are not, the focus is on growth and trade, not on growth and the balance of payments. In the history of economic thought, the only school to have emphasised the importance of foreign exchange and a strong balance of payments for economic growth was the Mercantilists.},

abstract = {The Polak’s macroeconomic monetary model reflecting the monetary approach to the balance of payments was developed in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its purpose is to integrate monetary, income and balance of payments analysis, and it became the basis of the conditionality applied to IMF credits. The dynamic nature of the Polak’s monetary model, in contrast to most academic monetary models of the balance of payments, yields not only the final equilibrium value of the endogenous variables but also the time path toward these values. This makes the model particularly suitable for presentation and manipulation in system-dynamic notation. Based on the original mathematical form of the Polak’s monetary model we constitute the causal loop diagram, first of the basic model and then the extended, goal oriented model variant. Based on the causal structure we also form the corresponding flow diagram of the model in POWERSIM notation. Polak’s model is especially suitable for operative application in IMF financial programming missions in developing countries. Since Croatia is one of these countries, it is chosen as a case to test applicability and validity of the system-dynamic version of Polak’s extended monetary model. The model parameters are calibrated and validity of the model is tested on the basis of data for the period of 1994-1996 (based on the quarterly data).},

The method, based on a transactions matrix, essentially makes sure that every flow goes somewhere and comes from somewhere, so that there are no black holes. The method is put to use to handle several issues: to demonstrate that there can be a separate portfolio (stock) demand for money, but not one independent from the rest of the model; to show that there cannot be an excess supply of credit; to handle the cases of credit for speculation purposes and high liquidity preference; to underline that endogenous money at fixed interest rates is still compatible with any government deficit; to show that, even when banks have liquidity norms, larger amounts of loans do not necessarily induce higher interest rates. Briefly put, the paper shows that many of the claims made by Horizontalist authors are confirmed when a fully coherent accounting framework is put in place to assess their claims.},

Recent accounts identify two causes of the finding of instability: the inherent difficulties of aggregation, and the individualistic model of consumer behaviour. The mathematical dead end reached by general equilibrium analysis is not due to obscure or esoteric aspects of the model, but rather arises from intentional design features, present in neoclassical theory since its beginnings. Modification of economic theory to overcome these underlying problems will require a new model of consumer choice, nonlinear analyses of social interactions, and recognition of the central role of institutional and social constraints.

We argue that the normal evolution of the international monetary system involves the emergence of a periphery for which the development strategy is export-led growth supported by undervalued exchange rates, capital controls and official capital outflows in the form of accumulation of reserve asset claims on the center country. The success of this strategy in fostering economic growth allows the periphery to graduate to the center. Financial liberalization, in turn, requires floating exchange rates among the center countries. But there is a line of countries waiting to follow the Europe of the 1950s/60s and Asia today sufficient to keep the system intact for the foreseeable future},

It performs better in the tests and provides superior exchange rate forecasts, both within- and out-of-sample.

Because intervention in financial markets is an important part of their development strategy, intervention in exchange and financial markets has, and we argue will continue to be, large and persistent enough to generate predictable deviations of exchange rates and relative yields in industrial country financial markets from normal cyclical patterns. We argue that management of the currency composition of international reserves by emerging market governments and central banks is unlikely to alter these conclusions.},

It will argue that macroeconomic analysis is facilitated if the main income and expenditure variables which make up the GDP are arranged in a double entry format so that they can all be seen as transactions involving at least two parties. Such a framework shows how the gap between each sector’s receipts and outlays implies an equivalent rise or fall in its net acquisition of financial assets. One conclusion will be that financial balances (relative to income flows) must stay within certain limits if debts are not to grow excessively, implying that the monitoring of these balances may yield a warning that unsustainable processes are at work, with strategic implications for the conduct of policy. Furthermore, the fact that the net acquisition of financial assets by any one sector necessarily implies an equivalent change in the opposite direction in the sum of net acquisition by other sectors, has strong implications for the way in which targets for public borrowing should be set. The main conclusions will be illustrated using US and UK data.},

Others (e.g., Bordo and Flandreau 2003), that even under the classical gold standard domestic monetary autonomy was considerable. This paper studies the coherence of international interest rates over more than 130 years. The constraints implied by the trilemma are largely borne out by history.},

The first part of the paper offers a novel theory to explain this phenomenon. Financialisation, the shareholder revolution and the development of a market for corporate control have shifted power to shareholders and thus changed management priorities, leading to a reduction in the desired growth rate. In the second part, the link between accumulation and financialisation is tested econometrically by means of a time series analysis of aggregate business investment for the USA, the UK, France and Germany. Extensive tests of robustness are performed. For the first three countries, evidence supporting the negative effect of financialisation on accumulation is found.},

@unpublished{Zezza2004a,
abstract = {The Theory of the Monetary Circuit (TMC) has received a growing interest among post- Keynesians in the last two decades. New developments have recently appeared from contributors to the two conferences in honor of Augusto Graziani,1 and a detailed analysis has recently appeared in Graziani (2003), where this approach is compared both to the classical and neoclassical tradition, and to other post-Keynesian approaches. In this paper, following Lavoie (2004), we investigate the implications for TMC models of laying down the corresponding set of stock-flow accounting, which must imply that every monetary flow comes from somewhere and goes somewhere, so that there are no “black holes”2. As the accounting is analyzed, it appears that several, if not all, contributors to the TMC fail to take properly into account how banks’ profits can be spent in the goods or the financial markets: in several models, interest payments on loans made from firms to banks are not accounted as part of national income, and simply disappear, instead of being treated as a possible source of demand for goods and/or financial assets. By ignoring the accounting and behavioral implications of interest payments, TMC models are usually characterized by a “Paradox of profits”: in a pure credit economy and considering a single production period, if firms receive an initial loan M to cover for their current expenditure, by selling goods and financial assets they can at most recover the amount of money M being injected into the economy at the beginning of the period. Firms can therefore pay back the principal to banks at the end of the period, but will not possibly have enough liquidity to pay for interests, unless (a) they pay interest in kind, or (b) at the end of the production period they remain indebted with banks, by an amount equal to interest payments. In our view, this result depends on interest payments disappearing from income or stock-flow accounting, and we will show how simple TMC models can be made consistent on this respect. In our approach, the TMC will also be reconciled with the Godley and Cripps (1983) approach, which laid the foundation for Godley’s developments in stock-flow consistent modelling in the post-Keynesian tradition. A further important point of TMC is related to whether investment is financed entirely from retained profits, and by issuing equities, or whether firms obtain additional loans from banks to finance investment. We will show that the distinction is not straightforward for the production sector as a whole, since an increase in demand for capital goods which is perfectly anticipated from firms producing capital goods will imply an equivalent increase in costs of production for this sector, and hence an increase in the initial loan required from banks.},

Subdividing the panel into sub-panels, we show that the B-S e¤ect is a common feature to all economies, but that the trad- able price-based real appreciation is a distinct feature of transition and emerging economies. We also show that in transition countries, a decrease in net foreign assets leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, instead of the depreciation predicted by theory. Comparing in-sample and out-of-sample estimates (in terms of the country coverage) of equilibrium exchange rates shows that these measures can yield di¤erent results, and could therefore be considered as complementary tools in judging misalign- ments.},

abstract = {Emerging market economies are fertile ground for the development of real estate and other financial bubbles. Despite these economies’ significant growth potential, their corporate and government sectors do not generate the financial instruments to provide residents with adequate stores of value. Capital often flows out of these economies seeking these stores of value in the developed world. Bubbles are beneficial because they provide domestic stores of value and thereby reduce capital outflows while increasing investment. But they come at a cost, as they expose the country to bubble-crashes and capital flow reversals. We show that domestic financial under- development not only facilitates the emergence of bubbles, but also leads agents to undervalue the aggregate risk embodied in financial bubbles. In this context, even rational bubbles can be welfare reducing. We study a set of aggregate risk management policies to alleviate the bubble-risk. We show that liquidity requirements, sterilization of capital inflows and structural policies aimed at developing public debt markets ‘collateralized’ by future revenues, all have a high payoff in this environment. r 2005 Elsevier B.V.

From quite similar starting points, the two countries pursued liberal reform programs that differed sharply, mainly as a result of exogenous differences in constitutional structures and the personal styles of the central actors. Australia followed a more cautious, piecemeal, consensus-based approach, whereas New Zealand adopted a radical, rapid, "purist" platform. The New Zealand reform package was generally seen by contemporary commentators as representing a "textbook" model for best-practice reform. However, Australia since 1984 has performed much better than New Zealand, whose per capita GDP (gross domestic product) growth indeed ranked at or near the bottom of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The article assesses a variety of explanations for the divergences in policies and outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Thus, Full Employment Is Only One Of Many Or Multiple Macro Equilibria. If An Economy Reaches An Underemployment Equilibrium, Something Is Necessary To Boost Or Stimulate Demand To Produce Full Employment. This Something Could Be Business Investment But Because Of The Logic And Individualist Nature Of Investment Decisions, It Is Unlikely To Rapidly Restore Full Employment. Keynes Logically Seizes Upon The Public Budget And Government Expenditures As The Quickest Way To Restore Full Employment. Borrowing The Money To Finance The Deficit From Private Households And Businesses Is A Quick, Direct Way To Restore Full Employment While At The Same Time, Redirecting Or Siphoning Off The Funds From The Private Sector Which Caused The Over-Production Is In The First Place. Keynes S Theory Is Unquestionably Significant In Understanding Of Modern Economics. Far From Being Destructive, It Alone Has Been Responsible For Nearly 60 Years Of Growth Without A Major Depression As We Experienced Worldwide In The 1930S.While The Present Book Is Indispensable For The Students, Researchers And Teachers Of Economics, It Is Highly Useful For The General Readers Keenly Interested In Understanding Nation S Economy.},

It is dependent on international capital flows, whose continuity becomes more and more critical given the current account deficit, which is estimated to reach 6.1{\%} as a ratio to GDP at the end of 2005. The paper assesses the sustainability of this speculation-led growth in the context of EU enlargement and compares the current state of fragility with former crises in Turkey as well as in East Asia and Latin America. Following a severe financial crisis in 2001, Turkey has entered a new phase of fragile growth led by boom-euphoric expectations. The paper aims at explaining this new phase and the evolution of the risk perceptions of both the creditors as well as the debtors in this “speculation game” based on the post-Keynesian/Minskyan concepts of endogenous expectations and financial fragility},

abstract = {The main pupose of this model is the investigation of the etiology of the financial structure of the differents economic units or groups of families in the economy, defining financial structure according to the theoretical framework given by the minskian financial fragility hypothesis. In particular, we have been concerned with the financial structure of families when buying houses with external finance, i.e., mortgages. Therefore it has been conceived as mean of analysis and measurement of the economy´s financial structure, that is, as one mechanism that generates and explains jointly the ordinary incomes and the payments commitments of debt for any economic units in the system. We consider an economy with two types of financial assets, banks deposits and state bonds, and two types of real assets, housing and productive capital. Families debt (mortgages) happens as the result of banks activity, that is, credit intermediation; any direct credit given by the bank to one family is necessarily related to another credit given by other firm or family to the bank, for example, when this family or firm puts its wealth in the form of a bank deposit. The state is the only agent that can ask for credit directly to any other economic agent, and can give credit to the banks as if it were the central bank. Within this general framework, we focus our investigation on the way housing spending determines the financial structure of the families, and therefore can affect the flows of salaries and the related mortgage payments, that includes the interest and debt redemption. Finally, let us indicate two types of precedents on which this research relies on. Those directly related with the modeling of keynesian theory through stock-flows model, the same type we have tried to develop in this work, as Dos Santos (2004), Godley (1999) and Moudud (1998); and the other is related to the general theoretical framework of capitalist financial fragility we take; particularly, the complete works of Minsky (1919-1996).},

abstract = {In order to mitigate climate change, deep reductions in CO2 emissions will be required in the coming decades. Carbon capture and storage will likely play an important role in these reductions. As a compli- ment to capturing CO2 from point sources, CO2 can be captured from ambient air (“air capture”), offsetting emissions from distributed sources or reducing atmospheric concentrations when emissions have already been constrained. In this thesis, we show that CO2 capture from air is physically and thermodynamically feasible, discuss the various routes available, and explain why NaOH solution is a viable sorbent for large- scale capture. An example system using NaOH spray is presented. With experimental data and a variety of numerical techniques, the use of NaOH spray for air capture is assessed and an example contacting system developed. The cost and energy requirements of the example contacting system are estimated. Contactor estimates are combined with estimates from industry and other research to estimate the cost of a complete air capture system. We ﬁnd that the cost of capturing CO2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 {\$}/t-CO2, and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper-bound cost to 130 {\$}/t-CO2. Even at the high calculated cost, air capture has implications for climate policy, however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower-cost systems.},

The model is Post-Keynesian in nature and puts a large emphasis on the role of conventions and the importance of the financial side. In doing so, it provides an innovative way to determine aggregate investment and to introduce nonlinearities in the modeling of Minsky’s framework. This nonlinearity relies on the shifting property of conventions and the behavioral and psychological assumptions that they carry. Another specific characteristic of the model is that it is stock-flow consistent and explicitly takes into account the amortization of principal and refinancing loans. All of the modeling is done by using system dynamics, a flexible but rigorous modeling tool that gives the modeler a good understanding of the dynamics of complex models.},

The model is presented in steady state and in out of steady state positions. In both cases it is shown that the pattern of growth in CARICOM, characterized by low growth, government and current account deficits, and mounting stock debt levels can be explained by the relationship between fiscal and foreign trade performance. The out of steady state position model includes in an explicit manner the private sector and provides an explicit transmission mechanism through the interaction of stocks and flows. The model highlights the binding character of the external constraint and argues that government expenditures do not necessarily result in low growth or high debt levels. The outcome depends on the interaction between government, external, and the private sector, an interaction that is the basis for stock- flow modelling},

abstract = {The ninth Geneva Report on the World Economy examines the main threats to finan- cial stability in the major industrial economies and the emerging economies, focusing on the implications of the major changes that have occurred in the glob- al financial system in the past two decades. At the time when the conference met in May 2007, it was customary to marvel at the long period of quiescence in world financial markets. Low risk premia and continuing high returns were increasingly seen as the inherent characteristics of the new international financial system. Many observers were confident that this happy situation would go on forever, fueled by unprecedented global risk diversi- fication and supported by amazingly sophisticated financial instruments. This was not the view of the report's authors and, indeed, much of the confer- ence focused on the flaws that were hidden but, few doubted, were there and would be revealed soon enough. As it turns out, we did not have to wait very long to witness a major crisis that affected the largest world interbank markets and severely dented the profits of many of the most prominent financial institutions. A first reason to read the report is to find how the careful observers who gathered in Geneva were concerned about many of the fault lines that emerged a few weeks later. Naturally, the authors of the ninth report have amended their text in the wake of the crisis, but they did not have to make drastic changes. They first examine financial stability from a macro perspective, considering macroeconomic imbal- ances, the decline (and spike) in financial market volatility and its causes, and international financial integration. They then adopt a micro perspective, consid- ering the implications for stability of the growth of household risk bearing, finan- cial sector consolidation, the emergence of new financial instruments and the growth of hedge funds. They conclude by assessing the policy implications of these developments, and their practical proposals ought to be considered with great attention. ICMB and CEPR are delighted to provide a forum for the authors to put forward this careful analysis of international financial stability. We are confident that it will be widely read and discussed. It should give policy-makers, academics and the informed public a more sophisticated understanding of these issues},

It follows from the model that if the fiscal stance is not set in the appropriate fashion that is, at a well-defined level and growth rate—then full employment and low inflation will not be achieved in a sustainable way. We also show that fiscal policy on its own could achieve both full employment and a target rate of inflation. Finally, we arrive at two unconventional conclusions: first, that an economy (described within an SFC framework) with a real rate of interest net of taxes that exceeds the real growth rate will not generate explosive interest flows, even when the government is not targeting primary surpluses; and, second, that it cannot be assumed that a debtor country requires a trade surplus if interest payments on debt are not to explode.},

abstract = {Financialization is a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes. Financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the macro and micro levels. Its principal impacts are to (1) elevate the significance of the financial sector relative to the real sector, (2) transfer income from the real sector to the financial sector, and (3) increase income inequality and contribute to wage stagnation. Additionally, there are reasons to believe that financialization may put the economy at risk of debt deflation and prolonged recession. Financialization operates through three different conduits: changes in the structure and operation of financial markets, changes in the behavior of nonfinancial corporations, and changes in economic policy. Countering financialization calls for a multifaceted agenda that (1) restores policy control over financial markets, (2) challenges the neoliberal economic policy paradigm encouraged by financialization, (3) makes corporations responsive to interests of stakeholders other than just financial markets, and (4) reforms the political process so as to diminish the influence of corporations and wealthy elites.},

It focuses on the question of whether this economic disaster represents a failure of efficient market theory, or whether it is the result of economic policies which ignored efficient market theory. A brief overview of economic history is presented, focusing on issues such as free markets, efficiency, and pricing. The view that markets are self-regulating is contrasted with the view that market failures can and should be corrected by government regulations. An argument is presented that government efforts to ameliorate financial disasters typically do more harm than good.},

abstract = {Since the late-1990s, the global economy is characterised by historically low risk premia and an unprecedented widening of external imbalances. This paper explores to what extent these two global trends can be understood as a reaction to three structural shocks in different regions of the global economy: (i) monetary shocks (“excess liquidity” hypothesis), (ii) preference shocks (“savings glut” hypothesis), and (iii) investment shocks (“investment drought” hypothesis). In order to uniquely identify these shocks in an integrated framework, we estimate structural VARs for the two main regions with widening imbalances, the United States and emerging Asia, using sign restrictions that are compatible with standard New Keynesian and Real Business Cycle models. Our results show that monetary shocks potentially explain the largest part of the variation in imbalances and financial market prices. We find that savings shocks and investment shocks explain less of the variation. Hence, a “liquidity glut” may have been a more important driver of real and financial imbalances in the US and emerging Asia than a “savings glut”.},

abstract = {We revisit the old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over “fully-adjusted positions”, defined by the long-run equality of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition of this paper is that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the (only possible) long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illus- trated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on Lavoie (2002, 2003). A “common language” for the conflicting claims by shareholders, manag- ers, workers is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these con- tradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate. The analysis unifies history and equilibrium in the sense that the nature of and the adjust- ment to the final equilibrium position depends on the objectives of the dominant social groups. We distinguish a “Fordist regime” and a “financialisation regime” and produce simulation results within a simple stock-flow consistent model that are broadly consis- tent with the stylised facts of these distinct historical phases of capitalism.},

abstract = {Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are probably the most utilized tool globally for development planning and macro policy analysis. Despite this their history is not available in the literature, their theoretical grounding is never explained, and the mechanics of the models remain hidden under layers of rhetoric, myths and hand gestures at various theoretical structures. Therefore, this paper explains what CGE models are, how they work, and where they came from. It will be shown that CGE models have always been and are macroeconomic models, and not based on general equilibrium theory. In doing so, it will detail how Walras’s general equilibrium is not equivalent to Arrow-Debreu’s General Equilibrium, and that CGE models use neither of those frameworks. Furthermore, this paper gives the history of the model and identifies its (relatively) few key variables, in order to explain how model builders construct CGE models, and consciously impose causality, while choosing exogenous variables that define results. CGE models can be a very useful policy tool, but only by understanding that it is a static fixed output model, not built for dynamic analysis along the lines of Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium. With this paper in hand, users will be able to know which questions to ask model builders, to ensure more transparency and clarity in future CGE models.},

abstract = {This paper constructs the aggregated and compact disaggregated financial social accounting matrices for Pakistan for the year 1999/2000. The extension of the SAM on financial side and inclusion of information on flow of funds is an important contribution of this study to the existing literature on social accounting matrices. A number of key characteristics of the real and financial sides of the economy are derived from the direct inspection of the financial social accounting matrices for Pakistan. The estimates of the SAM show a high share of agriculture sector in capital income, which is a reflection of land ownership structure in Pakistan. Similarly, there is a low share of wages in total factor income, which reflect that most of the workers in Pakistan are self employed and their income is recorded as capital income. The estimates of goods for domestic and export markets show that bulk of the gross domestic product was consumed domestically and only 16 percent was exported to the world market in the year 1999/2000. Furthermore, 58 percent of the total physical investment was made by the government and the contribution of non-financial firms in total physical investment was only 13 percent. During the same period the non-financial firms reduced their borrowing from the banking system which reflect uncomfortable environment for business activities in the year 1999/2000.

abstract = {Over the last decade or so, addressing financial instability has become a policy priority. Despite the efforts made, policymakers are still a long way from developing a satisfactory operational framework. A major challenge complicating this task is the fuzziness with which financial (in)stability can be measured. We review the available measurement methodologies and point out several weaknesses. In particular, we caution against heavy reliance on the current generation of macro stress tests, arguing that they can lull policymakers into a false sense of security. Nonetheless, we argue that the fuzziness in measurement does not prevent further progress towards an operational framework, as long as it is appropriately accounted for. Crucial features of that framework include: strengthening the macroprudential orientation of financial regulation and supervision; addressing more systematically the procyclicality of the financial system; relying as far as possible on automatic stabilisers rather than discretion, thereby lessening the burden on the real-time measurement of financial stability risks; and setting up institutional arrangements that leverage the comparative expertise of the various authorities involved in safeguarding financial stability, not least financial supervisors and central banks.},

Considerable attention is placed to the analysis of the channels through which the liquidity preference of these sectors can potentially affect the performance of a monetary production economy. It is argued that these channels are associated with i) the desired consumption and investment expenditures; ii) the asset allocation of households and banks; iii) the credit rationing and loan repayment procedure; iv) the lending and deposit interest rates; and v) the wage and profit claims of workers and firms respectively. In the simulations conducted we focus particular attention on how an uncertainty shock is likely to affect via the aforementioned channels the dynamics of employment and inflation. Furthermore, we explore the role that fiscal and monetary policy can arguably play if high employment and low inflation are to be attained in an environment of high perceived uncertainty and of diminished state of confidence.},

@inproceedings{Gordon2009,
abstract = {This paper differs from other recent critiques of “modern macro” based on DSGE models. It goes beyond criticizing these models for their assumptions of complete and efficient markets by proposing an alternative macroeconomic paradigm that is more suitable for tracing the links between financial bubbles and the commodity and labor markets of the real economy. The paper provides a fundamental critique of DSGE and the related core assumptions of modern business cycle macroeconomics. By attempting to combine sticky Calvo‐like prices in a theoretical setting that otherwise assumes that markets clear, DSGE macro becomes tangled in a web of contradictions. Once prices are sticky, markets fail to clear. Once markets fail to clear, workers are not moving back and forth on their voluntary labor supply curves, so the elasticity of such curves is irrelevant. Once markets fail to clear, firms are not sliding back and forth on their labor demand curves, and so it is irrelevant whether the price‐cost markup (i.e., slope of the labor demand curve) is negative or positive. The paper resurrects “1978‐era” macroeconomics that combines non‐market‐clearing aggregate demand based on incomplete price adjustment, together with a supply‐side invented in the mid‐1970s that recognizes the co‐existence of flexible auction‐market prices for commodities like oil and sticky prices for the remaining non‐oil economy. As combined in 1978‐era theories, empirical work, and pioneering intermediate macro textbooks, this merger of demand and supply resulted in a well‐articulated dynamic aggregate demand‐supply model that has stood the test of time in explaining both the multiplicity of links between the financial and real economies, as well as why inflation and unemployment can be both negatively and positively correlated. Along the way, the paper goes beyond most recent accounts of the worldwide economic crisis by pointing out numerous similarities between the leverage cycles of 1927‐29 and 2003‐06, particularly parallel regulatory failings in both episodes, and it links tightly the empirical lack of realism in the demand and supply sides of modern DSGE models with the empirical reality that has long been built into the 1978‐era paradigm resurrected here.},

abstract = {The model presented in this paper has two objectives. First, models global imbalances in a simple way while conserving real and - nancial approaches. This double approach is necessary because Global Im- balances are due to the conjunction of nancial and real phenomena: the increase in the price of commodities, the accumulation of foreign reserves by the Asian central banks, the limited absorption capacity of the OPEC countries, the insu cient development of the Asian nancial system and the perception of better returns in the US. shoThe second objective is to model the global saving glut hypothesis and to w its implications. We start with a model which consists of three identical countries and then we replicate the current pattern of global imbalances in introducing three asymmetries: a xed exchange rate between Asia and the United States, a limited absorption capacity in Asia and endogenous propen- sity to spend in the United States. In order to avoid the recession linked to the increase of their propensity to import, the United States increase their propensity to spend. This adjustment has a cost: (i) the Global Imbalances grow quickly with an increase of current account imbalances and net foreign assets in both the US and Asia ; (ii) the euro area supports an appreciation of its exchange rate which put it in a long depression.},

We show that this type of credit and financial cycle is hard to reconcile with existing economic theory and argue that, while the ‘global savings glut’ may account for the cycle’s initial phase, other factors — such as the conduct of monetary policy and perceptions of declining macroeconomic risk — were more important from the mid-2000s onwards.

More, the independence of central banks significantly increased in Europe after 1990, which could preclude the co-ordination between the fiscal and the monetary policies. In order to do so, we develop a two-country model suffering a fall in the state of confidence of banks. We contrast a rule on public expenditures with a rule on public deficits and a usual Taylor rule with a truncated Taylor rule. In the first country, the government implements a fiscal policy with automatic stabilizers and a central bank has a dual mandate: inflation and growth. There is a co-ordination between fiscal and monetary policies. The second country implements an orthodox fiscal policy (balanced budget) and the central bank has a unique objective: inflation.},

In this article, we examine the history of fluctuations in growth theory through the story of the "Solow residual" as a "black box." We show that after Solow's seminal contribution, the "residual" became a reproducible object. Losing its ties with the intentions and beliefs of its originator, it was given new and unexpected uses in other branches of macroeconomics. While the residual had always remained a problematic result in growth accounting, its borrowing by real business cycle theorists sought to establish it as a definitive representation of technology. As the claims of the New Classicals came under scrutiny, so did the status and meaning of the object residual. The integration of growth and cycle has since been shaped by the opening of this "black box." Edward Prescott has remained committed to his earlier interpretation of the "Solow residual" as stochastic technology. Others have sought to bracket multiple supply shocks as the residual, abandoning attempts to decompose it. To the New Keynesians the "residual" has been more evidence of market power and the need to integrate rigidities in the study of the cycle.},

abstract = {World macroeconomic adjustments are usually analysed with general equilibrium model or simpler portfolio models which are not always consistent at the world level in terms of assets and consider that all the adjustments are realised through relative prices with production remaining constant. Stock flow consistent (SFC) models in the lines of Godley and Lavoie (2004) and Zhao and Lavoie (2008) are more appropriate in this perspective. Three SFC three countries models have been considered, the first one with a fixed dollar-yuan parity including a version with Chinese foreign reserves’ diversification, the second with a flexible dollar-yuan parity which can be freely floating or following a more managed regime, the third one being a generalisation of the two others with flexible prices instead of constant prices. Several results can be outlined. The fixity of the dollar-yuan parity limits the adjustments facing shocks and world imbalances at the benefit of China and at the expense of the USA and the EU. The introduction of a diversification of China’s foreign reserves changes the adjustments mechanisms, mainly at the expense of the EU due to the dollar depreciation. In the second configuration a flexible dollar-yuan exchange rate appears as a powerful adjustment mechanism to reduce world imbalances characterised by a US deficit and a Chinese surplus. A freely floating yuan is actually unrealistic. But more managed exchange rate regimes for the dollar- yuan parity, where the Chinese Central Bank intervenes to reach a target, either on foreign reserves in dollars or on current account level, give rather similar adjustment mechanisms. Lastly, the model with flexible prices confirms the main results obtained with fixed prices},

Stock flow consistent (SFC) models in the lines of Godley and Lavoie (2004) and Zhao and Lavoie (2008) are more appropriate, as they give a comprehensive description of the real and financial flows and stocks at the world level, can include most of ingredients of the previous models and do not presuppose that adjustments are limited to relative prices. Two SFC three countries models have been considered, the first one with a fixed dollar-yuan parity including a version with Chinese foreign reserves’ diversification, the second with a flexible dollar-yuan parity which can be freely floating or following a Chinese Central Bank’s targeted policy on the level of the current account or of the reserves. In the first configuration, with fixed dollar-yuan parity, supply shocks like a loss of competitiveness have a significant impact on world imbalances. Initial shocks are partly compensated thanks to the euro-dollar variations but the fixity of the dollar-yuan parity limits the adjustments at the benefit of China and at the expense of the USA and the EU. The introduction of a diversification of China’s foreign reserves changes the adjustments mechanisms at the international level, mainly at the expense of the EU due to the dollar depreciation, but not in a radical manner. In the second configuration the dollar-yuan parity is floating according to various mechanisms. A flexible dollar-yuan exchange rate appears as a powerful adjustment mechanism to reduce world imbalances characterised by a US deficit and a Chinese surplus. The contrast is clear with the first configuration where only the euro-dollar exchange rate was floating with a fixed dollar-yuan parity. A freely floating yuan is unrealistic in the actual state of the Chinese monetary and financial system. But more managed exchange rate regimes for the dollar-yuan parity, where the Chinese Central Bank intervenes to reach a target, either on foreign reserves in dollars or on current account level, give rather similar adjustment mechanisms. In spite of its theoretical aspect, the pure floating yuan regime can be used as a useful reference to examine in more details the differences between fixed and floating exchange rate regimes},

abstract = {Among the policy responses to the global financial crisis, the international provision of US dollars via central bank swap lines stands out. This paper studies the build-up of stresses on banks' balance sheets that led to this coordinated policy response. Using the BIS international banking statistics, we reconstruct the worldwide consolidated balance sheets of the major national banking systems. This allows us to investigate the structure of banks' global operations across their offices in various countries, shedding light on how their international asset positions are funded across currencies and counterparties. The analysis first highlights why a country's "national balance sheet", a residency-based measure, can be a misleading guide to where the vulnerabilities faced by that country's national banking system (or residents) lie. It then focuses on banking systems' consolidated balance sheets, and shows how the growth (since 2000) in European and Japanese banks' US dollar assets produced structural US dollar funding requirements, setting the stage for the dollar shortage when interbank and swap markets became impaired.},

First, the role of the economist John Maynard Keynes—as theoretician, compiler, supporter and user—is addressed. This role is substantial and has been greatly misunderstood or misrepresented by a large part of the literature. Second, the pioneering contributions made at the start of the 20th century by Alfred Flux, Arthur Bowley and Josiah Stamp, and later by Colin Clark, are detailed. The debates between these men mark the emergence of National Accounts as a serious discipline. Their work was supported by the earlier theoretical contributions of Alfred Marshall, and by practical developments, in particular the instigation of a Census of Production in 1907. Taken together, the two considerations tell a good part of the story of the emergence of National Accounting on the world stage.},

We examine this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper conduits set up by large commercial banks. We show that both banks located in surplus countries and banks located in deficit countries manufactured riskless assets of {\$}1.2 trillion by selling short-term asset-backed commercial paper to risk-averse investors, predominantly US money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long term US assets. As negative information about US assets became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and deficit countries experienced difficulties rolling over asset-backed commercial paper and as a result suffered significant losses. We conclude that it was global banking flows, and not just global imbalances, that determined the geography of the financial crisis},

@article{Adam2010,
abstract = {This paper describes the origins of the global financial crisis and how the prevailing New Key- nesian macroeconomic orthodoxy failed to anticipate its severity. This failure, we argue, stemmed from an incomplete understanding of the pivotal role of financial institutions in the amplification of the crisis and its transmission to the wider economy. Low global interest rates and a consequent ‘search for yield’ in the pre-crisis period encouraged financial institutions to build highly leveraged balance sheets which, in turn, generated extremely large asset-price movements when a ‘small event’—the downturn in the US sub-prime mortgage market—triggered theworldwide crisis. The paper then briefly describes the element of the broadly successful and coordinated macroeconomic policy response to the crisis before turning to the medium-term challenges facing policy-makers in sustaining global recovery. At the national level, we focus on the reso- lution of fiscal imbalances which contributed, in part, to the crisis, and which then worsened because of the policy actions which have been taken to deal with it. At the international level, we emphasize the need to rectify the imbalances between savings and investment inmany significant countries. Thiswill require greater coordination of macroeconomic policy across the world’s major economies. It will also involve strengthening the role, and the governance, of the International Monetary Fund},

abstract = {The world economy is just starting to recover from the most disastrous episode in the history of financial globalisation. Understanding what happened is essential. Anton Brender and Florence Pisani, both economists with Dexia Asset Management and teaching at Paris-Dauphine University, argue in this book that the main problems were deeply rooted and are to be found in two tightly linked developments that for many years were left largely uncontrolled: the increase in the intensity of international transfers of savings – the so-called ‘global imbalances’ – and a wave of innovations – globalised finance – that have changed the way savings and the risks associated with their investment can be transferred.Globalised finance allowed continuously increasing amounts of emerging countries’ savings, invested in ‘risk-free’ assets, to finance loans that were far from being risk-free. The risks attendant on those loans did not vanish of course: they were carried by the risk-takers of the globalised financial system. Hedge-funds, investment banks, off-balance-sheet vehicles, etc. functioned here as parts of a genuine alternative banking system, taking on the bulk of the liquidity, interest-rate and credit risks generated by the mismatch between the assets that emerging regions’ savers were ready to – or could – invest in and the liabilities developed countries’ borrowers issued. Unfortunately, no one was in charge of keeping in check either the quantity of risk being accumulated in this way or the quality of the loans generating those risks. The consequence was terrible: the only force that could finally rein in the continuous deepening of the global imbalances was the collapse of globalised finance.},

abstract = {In this paper the author discusses the possibility that the U.S. economy may become enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years. To frame the discussion, the author relies on an analysis that emphasizes two possible long-run steady states for the economy: one that is consistent with monetary policy as it has typically been implemented in the United States in recent years and one that is consistent with the low nominal interest rate, deflationary regime observed in Japan during the same period. The data considered seem to be quite consistent with the two steady-state possibilities. The author describes and critiques seven stories that are told in monetary policy circles regarding this analysis and emphasizes two main conclusions: (i) The Federal Open Market Committee's "extended period" language may be increasing the probability of a Japanese-style outcome for the United States and (ii), on balance, the U.S. quantitative easing program offers the best tool to avoid such an outcome.},

@unpublished{Caballero2010a,
abstract = {One of the main economic villains before the crisis was the presence of large “global imbalances.” The concern was that the U.S. would experience a sudden stop of capital flows, which would unavoidably drag the world economy into a deep recession. However, when the crisis finally did come, the mechanism did not at all resemble the feared sudden stop. Quite the opposite, during the crisis net capital inflows to the U.S. were a stabilizing rather than a destabilizing source. I argue instead that the root imbalance was of a different kind: The entire world had an insatiable demand for safe debt instruments that put an enormous pressure on the U.S. financial system and its incentives (and this was facilitated by regulatory mistakes). The crisis itself was the result of the negative feedback loop between the initial tremors in the financial industry created to bridge the safe-assets gap and the panic associated with the chaotic unraveling of this complex industry. Essentially, the financial sector was able to create “safe” assets from the securitization of lower quality ones, but at the cost of exposing the economy to a systemic panic. This structural problem can be alleviated if governments around the world explicitly absorb a larger share of the systemic risk. The options for doing this range from surplus countries rebalancing their portfolios toward riskier assets, to private-public solutions where asset-producer countries preserve the good parts of the securitization industry while removing the systemic risk from the banks’ balance sheets. Such public-private solutions could be designed with fee structures that could incorporate all kind of too-big- or too-interconnected-to-fail considerations.},

abstract = {This article examines, in the light of recent events, the origins of the difficulties that current macroeconomic models have in encompassing the sort of sudden crisis which we are currently observing. The reasons for this are partly due to fundamental problems with the underlying General Equilibrium theory and partly to the unrealistic assumptions on which most financial models are based. What is common to the two is that systematic warnings over more than a century in the case of finance and over 30 years in the case of equilibrium theory have been ignored and we have persisted with models which are both unsound theoretically and incompatible with the data. It is suggested that we drop the unrealistic individual basis for aggregate behaviour and the even more unreasonable assumption that the aggregate behaves like such a ‘rational’ individual. We should rather analyse the economy as a complex adaptive system, and take the network structure that governs interaction into account. Models that do this, of which two examples are given, unlike standard macroeconomic models, may at least enable us to envisage major ‘phase transitions’ in the economy even if we are unlikely to be able to forecast the timing of their onset.

abstract = {Peri-urbanization is not only triggered by socio-economic development but also resulted from interactions between humans and their environment. An integrated model that links a stock-flow model with an agent-based model can enhance our understanding of the interactions among land use, human decision-making, and environmental change. In this paper, we provide an illustration of a joint application of stock-flow and agent-based modelling to simulate land cover change from agricultural landscape to an urbanized system via the integration of biophysical approach and decision making bodies of land cover change. Therefore, a case study is used to demonstrate the change patterns of agricultural land and urban land. The major stocks and flows and their interactions can be represented in the conceptual energy diagram. The rate of urban asset accumulation determines the amount of areas which should be converted to urban built-up lands. Three main agents of the study area have been chosen and their action rules are used to allocate land use activities on the most suitable places which can reveal the results of decision making. Results indicate that the dynamic changes of the peri-urbanization in the study region arise from lands adjacent to built-up lands or along the roads where are easily accessible to plain agricultural lands with flat topography.},

abstract = {The years leading up to the financial crisis are widely acclaimed as a period of remarkable, if not$\backslash$nunprecedented, stability in the global economy. From a perspective that focuses on the value and$\backslash$nvolume of gross domestic product, that assessment is valid. The world's major economies enjoyed a$\backslash$nsustained period of growth. Inflation was low and stable. But from a perspective that focuses on$\backslash$nthe value of financial assets and on the volume of market activity, this period was anything but$\backslash$nstable. The past decade has borne witness to sharp swings in asset prices and a large expansion in$\backslash$ncredit and balance sheets. This paper considers a flow-of-funds approach that stresses the role of$\backslash$nasset prices, credit and balance sheets. This framework is used to shine a different light on the$\backslash$nGreat Moderation in the United Kingdom. It suggests that there were linkages between many of the$\backslash$nmacroeconomic puzzles of the day and the balance sheet developments that led to financial$\backslash$ninstability. It further argues that approaches to macroeconomics that stress the importance of$\backslash$nbalance sheet linkages might be helpful in spotting building financial fragility.},

In addition, the extended rise in U.S. house prices was likely also supported by long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates) that were surprisingly low, given the level of short-term rates and other macro fundamentals—a development that Greenspan (2005) dubbed a “conundrum.” The “global saving glut” (GSG) hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005 and 2007) argues that increased capital inflows to the United States from countries in which desired saving greatly exceeded desired investment—including Asian emerging markets and commodity exporters— were an important reason that U.S. longer-term interest rates during this period were lower than expected.},

abstract = {Given the economy’s complex behavior and sudden transitions as evidenced in the 2007–08 crisis, agent-based models are widely considered a promising alternative to current macroeconomic practice dominated by DSGE models. Their failure is commonly interpreted as a failure to incorporate heterogeneous interacting agents. This paper explains that complex behavior and sudden transitions also arise from the economy’s financial structure as reflected in its balance sheets, not just from heterogeneous interacting agents. It introduces “flow-of-funds” and “accounting” models, which were preeminent in successful anticipations of the recent crisis. In illustration, a simple balance-sheet model of the economy is developed to demonstrate that nonlinear behavior and sudden transition may arise from the economy’s balance-sheet structure, even without any microfoundations. The paper concludes by discussing one recent example of combining flow-of-funds and agent- based models. This appears a promising avenue for future research},

The crisis has encouraged a sharper focus on systemic risk, the inclusion of a financial sector in macroeconomic models, a shift from a microprudential to a macroprudential orientation in regulation and supervision, and questions about whether price stability is a sufficient criterion to guide monetary policy. In the process, it has led to a rediscovery of the macroeconomic roots of financial instability. This paper argues that this development is welcome but has not gone far enough. To substantiate this conclusion, the paper documents this analytical and policy journey before suggesting a way forward.

abstract = {Global current account imbalances have been at the forefront of policy debates over the past few years. Many observers have recently singled them out as a key factor contributing to the global financial crisis. Current account surpluses in several emerging market economies are said to have helped fuel the credit booms and risk-taking in the major advanced deficit countries at the core of the crisis, by putting significant downward pressure on world interest rates and/or by simply financing the booms in those countries (the "excess saving" view). We argue that this perspective on global imbalances bears reconsideration. We highlight two conceptual problems: (i) drawing inferences about a country's cross-border financing activity based on observations of net capital flows; and (ii) explaining market interest rates through the saving-investment framework. We trace the shortcomings of this perspective to a failure to consider the distinguishing characteristics of a monetary economy. We conjecture that the main contributing factor to the financial crisis was not "excess saving" but the "excess elasticity" of the international monetary and financial system: the monetary and financial regimes in place failed to restrain the build-up of unsustainable credit and asset price booms ("financial imbalances"). Credit creation, a defining feature of a monetary economy, plays a key role in this story.},

abstract = {This contribution addresses the question of whether growth convergence can be sustained in the global economy without compromising welfare and without causing major crises. It employs a simplified stock-flow analytical framework to examine the proposition that the pace and pattern of global growth is conditioned by 'under-consumption' in some regions of the world and 'over-borrowing' in other regions. A baseline projection using the Cambridge-Alphametrics model (CAM) illustrates consequences of resumed global imbalances after the 2008-2009 crisis. An alternative scenario exemplifies the case in which China and India shift towards internal income redistribution and domestic demand-orientated policies and suggests that this will not be sufficient to correct global imbalances or induce improved growth rates in other developing regions. Finally a more ambitious development perspective is simulated. Such a scenario requires internationally-coordinated policy efforts, with a greater role for governments in the management of demand, income distribution and environmental sustainability, as well as measures to reduce instability of exchange rate and commodity markets.},

abstract = {We examine whether the behavior of current account balances changed in the years preceding the global crisis of 2008-09, and assess the prospects for global imbalances in the post-crisis period. Changes in the budget balance are an important factor affecting current account balances for deficit countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. The effect of the “saving glut variables” on current account balances has been relatively stable for emerging market countries, suggesting that those factors cannot explain the bulk of their recent current account movements. We also find the 2006-08 period to constitute a structural break for emerging market countries, and to a lesser extent, for industrialized countries. We attribute the anomalous behavior of pre-crisis current account balances to stock market performance and real housing appreciation; fiscal procyclicality and the stance of monetary policy do not matter as much. Household leverage also appears to explain some of the standard model’s prediction errors. Looking forward, U.S., fiscal consolidation alone cannot induce significant deficit reduction. For China, financial development might help shrink its current account surplus, but only when it is coupled with financial liberalization. These findings suggest that unless countries implement substantially more policy change, global imbalances are unlikely to disappear.},

abstract = {Walter Bagehot's Lombard Street, published in 1873 in the wake of a devastating London bank collapse, explained in clear and straightforward terms why central banks must serve as the lender of last resort to ensure liquidity in a faltering credit system. Bagehot's book set down the principles that helped define the role of modern central banks, particularly in times of crisis--but the recent global financial meltdown has posed unforeseen challenges. The New Lombard Street lays out the innovative principles needed to address the instability of today's markets and to rebuild our financial system. Revealing how we arrived at the current crisis, Perry Mehrling traces the evolution of ideas and institutions in the American banking system since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913. He explains how the Fed took classic central banking wisdom from Britain and Europe and adapted it to America's unique and considerably more volatile financial conditions. Mehrling demonstrates how the Fed increasingly found itself serving as the dealer of last resort to ensure the liquidity of securities markets--most dramatically amid the recent financial crisis. Now, as fallout from the crisis forces the Fed to adapt in unprecedented ways, new principles are needed to guide it. In The New Lombard Street, Mehrling persuasively argues for a return to the classic central bankers' "money view," which looks to the money market to assess risk and restore faith in our financial system.},

abstract = {In the last few years, a number of scholars has referred to the crop of contributions of Hyman P. Minsky as required readings to understanding the tendency of the capitalist economies to fall into recurring crises. The so-called „financial instability hypothesis‟ of Minsky relies, however, on very disputed assumptions. Moreover, Minsky‟s analysis of capitalism must be updated on the basis of the deep changes which, during the last three decades, have concerned the world economy. In order to overcome these theoretical difficulties, section 2 of the paper deals with the analytical structure of the financial instability theory, showing why this latter cannot be regarded as a general theory of the business cycle. Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with a simplified, but consistent, re-formulation of some of the most disputed aspects of Minsky‟s theory by cross-breeding it with inputs from the „Circuitist‟ approach and the current Post Keynesian literature. In sections 6 and 7 we analyze the impact of both capital-asset inflation and consumer credit on the financial „soundness‟ of the economy, within a simplified stock-flow consistent monetary circuit model. Some concluding remarks are provided in the last part of the paper (section 8)},

abstract = {According to the mainstream view, labour market institutions (LMIs) are the key determinants of unemployment in the medium run. The actual empirical explanatory power of measures for labour market institutions, however, has recently been called into question. The Keynesian view holds periods of high real interest rates and insufficient capital accumulation responsible for unemployment. Empirical work in this tradition has paid little attention to the role of LMIs. This paper contributes to the debate by highlighting the role of autonomous changes in capital accumulation as a macroeconomic shock. In the empirical analysis, medium-term unemployment is explained by capital accumulation, LMIs and a number of macroeconomic shocks in a panel analysis covering 20 OECD countries. The economic effects of changes in LMI, variations in capital accumulation and other macro shocks are compared. Capital accumulation and the real interest rate are found to have statistically significant effects that are robust to the inclusion of control variables and show larger effects than LMI.

Rather than finding the origins in recent developments, this paper links the crisis to the long-term transformation of the economy from a robust financial structure in the 1950s to the fragile one that existed at the beginning of this crisis in 2007. As Minsky said, Stability is destabilizing: the relative stability of the economy in the early postwar period encouraged this transformation of the economy. Todays crisis is rooted in what he called money manager capitalism, the current stage of capitalism dominated by highly leveraged funds seeking maximum returns in an environment that systematically under-prices risk. With little regulation or supervision of financial institutions, money managers have concocted increasingly esoteric instruments that quickly spread around the world. Those playing along are rewarded with high returns because highly leveraged funding drives up prices for the underlying assets. Since each subsequent bust wipes out only a portion of the managed money, a new boom inevitably rises. Perhaps this will prove to be the end of this stage of capitalism the money manager phase. Of course, it is too early even to speculate on the form capitalism will take. I will only briefly outline some policy implications.},

The shadow banking system consists of a web of specialized financial institutions that conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation without direct, explicit access to public backstops. The lack of such access to sources of government liquidity and credit backstops makes shadow banks inherently fragile. Much of shadow banking activities is intertwined with the operations of core regulated institutions such as bank holding companies and insurance companies, thus creating a source of systemic risk for the financial system at large. We review fundamental reasons for the existence of shadow banking, explain the functioning of shadow banking institutions and activities, discuss why shadow banks need to be regulated, and review the impact of recent reform efforts on shadow banking credit intermediation.},

We show that when China pegs its currency to a currency basket composed of the dollar, the euro, and a numeraire currency representing the ‘rest of the world,’ the impact, scale, and transmission of a loss of competitiveness shock on the current account will depend on the country suffering the shock, either in the currency basket and the weight of currencies in the basket. Our sensitivity tests to changes in the weights within the basket of currencies confirm that the adjustments are linked to the composition of the currency basket. We conclude that too stringent a system of anchoring to a basket of currencies could limit the rebalancing of current accounts.},

But the discussion of fiscal multipliers is even more relevant now that several European countries have had to quickly retract their stimulus measures in an effort to regain market confidence. Using regime-switching VARs we estimate the impact of fiscal adjustment on the United States, Europe and Japan allowing for fiscal multipliers to vary across recessions and booms. We also estimate ex ante probabilities of recessions derived in association with different-sized and different types of consolidation shocks (expenditure-versus tax-based). We use these estimates to understand how consolidations should be designed to be most effective in terms of permanently and rapidly reducing a country's debt-to-GDP ratio. The main finding is that smooth and gradual consolidations are to be preferred to frontloaded or aggressive consolidations, especially for economies in recession facing high risk premia on public debt, because sheltering growth is key to the success of fiscal consolidation in these cases.},

abstract = {Relative to the "global savings glut" (GSG) hypothesis, we present a more complete picture of how capital flows contributed to the financial crisis, drawing attention to the sizable inflows from European investors into U.S. private-label asset-backed securities (ABS), including mortgage-backed securities and other structured investment products. The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates.},

We introduce a stock-flow consistent dynamic model where the economic system is represented by a network of trading relation- ships among agents. Debt contracts are one of such relationships. The model is characterized by a unique and stable steady-state, which pre- dicts that (i) aggregate income is always limited from the above by the money supply and that (ii) debts cause a redistribution of borrowers’ wealth and income in favor of lenders. In the aggregate this may also lower nominal income, as empirical evidence suggests.},

@article{Dow2012,
abstract = {The economic crisis has exposed shortcomings in standard economic theory and provided an impetus for new economic thinking. But the theoretical debate in the wake of the crisis has been unduly constrained by the terms of the mainstream approach to economic theory. Like any approach, it is characterised by a way of framing reality, giving meaning to terms and setting criteria for good argument. It also determines how any economic theory is understood, whether from the history of economic thought or from the contemporary literature. But there are other approaches to economics which would open up the field to a much wider range of possibilities for new economic thinking. Addressing the challenge that any reader bases her understanding on her own approach, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to explain what it means to consider different approaches and why it matters for policy. This is done by discussing two features of the financial crisis which pose particular problems for economic theory. These are the role of changing market sentiment in driving asset prices on the one hand and the breakdown of trust relationships in banking on the other (the moral hazard issue). We will see how these are addressed by mainstream theory and by alternative approaches. First, market sentiment is discussed within the mainstream rational-optimising framework, where risk is quantifiable, and compared with the Keynesian approach based on the general uncertainty of knowledge, where reason, evidence and sentiment are integrated. The moral hazard issue is then discussed in its mainstream form in terms of rational opportunism and in its institutionalist form in terms of the foundation of social relations (including relations between institutions) in trust. It is shown that different ways of approaching theorising in each case imply different policy measures. It is argued further that an exclusively deductive mathematical approach to analysis of market sentiment and trust is unduly limiting and that a more pluralist approach would more fully address the issues},

@phdthesis{Michell2012,
abstract = {This thesis presents a detailed flow-of-funds analysis of the Chinese economy since 1992. An original theoretical approach to endogenous money, investment and profits is developed alongside the empirical analysis. It is argued that standard modern macroeconomic theory, such as the New Keynesian monetary macroeconomics and neoclassical growth theory are unsuited to the analysis of a long-run disequilibrium credit-financed investment- driven growth path such as that which has taken place in China. Using an approach built on accounting foundations, rather than the optimis- ing behaviour of representative agents, an analysis of credit creation, investment and growth is presented inwhich firms’ investment expenditures are the key fac- tor in determining the dynamic evolution of the system. Steindl’s analysis of the “maldistribution of profits” is updated and re-worked in the context of state con- trol over the “cartelised” firms’ sector. It is argued that the credit-financed invest- ment expenditures of the state-owned sector play the decisive role in generating the aggregate demand which has driven high growth rates in China, while si- multaneously conditioning the outcomes in terms of profit generation,monetary expansion and the distribution of liquidity and leverage. The development of the theoretical analysis is informed by a detailed em- pirical examination of the processes of money creation, investment and profits over the last twenty years in China. The empirical approach follows the theoret- ical analysis in that it is also based around the flow-of-funds national accounting system, resulting in an integrated and coherent analytical structure in which all transactions are matched by equivalent and opposite transactions elsewhere in the system.},

@article{Passarella2012,
abstract = {In the last few years, many financial analysts and heterodox economists (but even some „dissenters‟ among orthodox economists) have referred to the contribution of Hyman P. Minsky as fundamental to understanding the current crisis. However, it is well-known that the traditional formulation of Minsky‟s „financial instability hypothesis‟ shows serious internal logical problems. Furthermore, Minsky‟s analysis of capitalism must be updated on the basis of the deep changes which, during the last three decades, have concerned the world economy. In order to overcome these theoretical and empirical troubles, this paper, first, introduces the reader to the „mechanics‟ of the financial instability theory, according to the formulation of the traditional Minskian literature (section 2). Second, it shows „why‟ Minsky‟s theory cannot be regarded as a general theory of the business cycle (section 3). Third, the paper attempts to supply a simplified, but consistent, re-formulation of Minsky‟s theory by inter-breeding it with inputs coming from the „New Cambridge‟ theories and the current „formal Minskian literature‟. The aim of this is to analyze the impact of both capital-asset inflation and consumer credit on the financial „soundness‟ of the non-financial business sector (sections 4-7). Some concluding remarks are provided in the last part of the paper (section 8)},

abstract = {The rapid growth of the market-based financial system since the mid-1980s changed the nature of financial intermediation. Within the market-based financial system, “shadow banks” have served a critical role. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that con- duct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without explicit access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, limited-purpose finance companies (LPFCs), and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system. Our de- scription and taxonomy of shadow bank entities and shadow bank activities are accom- panied by “shadow banking maps” that schematically represent the funding flows of the shadow banking system},

abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, we observe a global increase of current account imbalances. In 2007, before the climax of the financial crisis, they reached 2{\%} of world GDP in absolute value. At the global level, the persistence of large current account imbalances is a threat to the macroeconomic and macrofinancial stability. This thesis analyses this phenomenon of global imbalances by using two complementary approaches: equilibrium exchange rates models and stock-flow consistent models. These two approaches can be considered as complementary insofar as they analyze the same problem from a different point of view. Equilibrium exchange rate models and particularly the FEER approach introduced by Williamson (1994) try to calculate exchange rate variations needed to reach a sustainable current account balance. Stock-flow consistent models {\`{a}} la Godley-Lavoie (2007) seek to analyze adjustments in terms of level of output and exchange rate dynamics in a context of imbalances. A return of large imbalances is not excluded. It appears that an international monetary cooperation aimed at preventing the return of large imbalances at the world and intra-European levels is a necessary condition to ensure global recovery.},

abstract = {This paper provides a logical framework for complexity economics. Complexity economics builds from the proposition that the economy is not necessarily in equilibrium: economic agents (firms, consumers, investors) constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. This further changes the outcome, which requires them to adjust afresh. Agents thus live in a world where their beliefs and strategies are constantly being “tested” for survival within an outcome or “ecology” these beliefs and strategies together create. Economics has largely avoided this nonequilibrium view in the past, but if we allow it, we see patterns or phenomena not visible to equilibrium analysis. These emerge probabilistically, last for some time and dissipate, and they correspond to complex structures in other fields. We also see the economy not as something given and existing but forming from a constantly developing set of technological innovations, institutions, and arrangements that draw forth further innovations, institutions and arrangements.

abstract = {The main problem discussed in this paper is whether a balance of payments con- straint exists within the Euro area. It is argued that the question of a member state’s foreign position is still relevant, at difference from what happens in successful cur- rency areas like the USA, where persistent imbalances in the payments from one dis- trict to another are acceptable and are made sustainable by financial transfers revolving around the system of taxes and transfers and the public debt. A currency area is an area where the price of a deposit with the banking system is the same wherever the deposit is held (i.e. there is uniformity in the value of commercial bank money). Persistent imbalances in payments between regions within the area are to be settled in either the common currency or (which is basically the same thing) the public debt. But while this is acceptable in the USA, it is far from acceptable in the Euro area, where creditor countries (Germany being by far the most important) clamour for a settlement in ‘hard assets’, like, e.g. state-owned real estate, if not gold. This means that a balance of payments constraint still binds state members of the Euro area, and is a serious threat to its survival},

Moreover, an increase in the corporate financial balance or a decrease in the labour income share leads to an increase in the current account. This finding is consistent with the view that consumers do not fully ‘pierce the corporate veil’.

Each country has a household sector and a non-household (corporate) sector. The household sector is divided into income deciles, and consumer demand is characterized by upward-looking status comparisons following the relative income hypothesis of consumption. The strength of consumption emulation depends on country-specific institutions. The model is calibrated for the United States, Germany and China. Simulations suggest that a substantial part of the increase in household debt and the decrease in the current account in the United States since the early 1980s can be explained by the interplay of rising (top-end) household income inequality and institutions. On the other hand, the weak domestic demand and increasing current account balances of Germany and China since the mid-1990s are strongly related to shifts in the functional income distribution at the expense of the household sector.},

Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos (2006) and, above all, after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie’s Stock-flow Consistent Approach (2007). The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (1) how the models are solved, (2) the treatment of time and its implication, and (3) the need — or not — of microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialization, exchange rate modeling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature, and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) over the possible lines of development of the stock-flow consistent models.},

My results suggest that at the end of 2008, domestic shadow-bank funding of the nonfinancial sector was an important, but fairly modest source of funding relative to that provided by more traditional funding sources such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. However,my results suggest that domestic shadow banking played a large role in the increase of nonfinancial-sector debt in the two years before 2008:Q4 and was, at least in an arithmetic sense,the entire reason for the slowdown in nonfinancial-sector debt growth after 2008. Domestic shadow-bank funding of the nonfinancial sector has increased since 2010, but remains well below the level seen right in late 2008.},

We hypothesize that spending out of wealth came to finance a wider range of GDP components such that it smoothed GDP. Both these trends combined would be consistent with a decrease in the volatility of output. We suggest testable implications in terms of both growth of credit and output and volatility of growth. In a multivariate GARCH framework, we test this view for home mortgages and residential investment. We observe unidirectional causality in variance from total output, residential investment and non-residential output to mortgage lending before, but not during the Great Moderation. These findings are consistent with a role for credit dynamics in explaining the Great Moderation.},

abstract = {The global financial crisis, which began in August 2007 and continues with no end in sight, has thrown macroeconomics into turmoil. This book challenges the current mainstream macroeconomic tradition, rejecting the view that whatever shock hits the economy, the response is an automatic and rapid move towards market equilibrium that pulls the economy out of any kind of difficult situation. Engaging with the structural problems of our times, especially in the context of the global financial crisis, the essays not just engage with Keynesian economics, but also adapt and go beyond it as per the requirements of present conditions. The essays apply the 'Keynesian spirit' to cover four broad areas: effective demand in the crisis, economic theory in the context of world recession, money and international liquidity, and finance and international economic disorder. Suggesting an alternative future of macroeconomics, this volume inspires and provokes new economic thinking that is needed for the world today.

@inproceedings{Knibbe2013,
abstract = {The lack of attention to the stock of debt and, to an extent, the flow of credit by central banks and central bankers was one of the reasons why the Great Financial Crisis took them by surprise. Their focus on consumer price inflation led them astray. This is remarkable, as the very monetary statistics of the central banks are based upon the idea that money creation is ‘joined at the hip’ with debt creation: ‘loans create deposits’. The statistics show this, including sectoral differences and differences between loans. This enables central banks to differentiate between different sources of money growth. National differences as well as differences between debts for asset purchases and debts to finance productive investments come to mind. Monetary statistics which are more focused on national differences and debt will, in the Eurozone, also enable a more coherent formulation of national and Eurozone economic policies as the data matrix of the EU ‘Macro Economic Imbalances Procedure’ Eurostat financial accounts of countries already contains sectoral debt and asset price related variables. Using ‘debt’ as a standard element of monetary analysis however requires a wholesale acceptance of the idea, inherent in the statistics but not in central bank monetary philosophy, that money and debt creation constitute an endogenous, dynamic process largely outside the control of central banks. To enable this a much broader concept of ‘Money’ than the rather narrow concept which at the moment dominates monetary analysis is needed. Much attention is paid to establish such a concept, which unlike the present concept is consistent with monetary statistics, quadruple entry accounting, the reality of economic transactions as well as monetary history.},

We characterize shadow banking as “money market funding of capital market lending” and construct a model of such a system with dealers making markets and setting prices for funding and risk. Using this model, we describe the secular expansion of the market-based credit system and its rapid collapse during the global financial crisis. The model also clarifies the economic functions of the market-based credit system, the role of the central bank in such a system, and the global character of US dollar funding markets.},

@article{Palley2013,
abstract = {This paper argues the euro zone crisis is the product of a toxic neoliberal economic policy cock- tail. The mixing of that cocktail traces all the way back to the early 1980s when Europe embraced the neoliberal economic model that undermined the income and demand generation process via wage stagnation and widened income inequality. Stagnation was serially postponed by a number of developments, including the stimulus from German re-unification and the low interest rate con- vergence produced by creation of the euro. The latter prompted a ten year credit and asset price bubble that created fictitious prosperity. Postponing stagnation in this fashion has had costs because it worsened the ultimate stagnation by creating large build-ups of debt. Additionally, the creation of the euro ensconced a flawed monetary system that fosters public debt crisis and the political economy of fiscal austerity. Lastly, during this period of postponement, Germany sought to avoid stagnation via export-led growth based on wage repression. That has created an internal balance of payments problem within the euro zone that is a further impediment to resolving the crisis. There is a way out of the crisis. It requires replacing the neoliberal economic model with a structu- ral Keynesian model; remaking the European Central Bank so that it acts as government banker; having Germany replace its export-led growth wage suppression model with a domestic demand- led growth model; and creating a pan-European model of wage and fiscal policy coordination that blocks race to the bottom tendencies within Europe. Countries, particularly Germany, can implement some of this agenda on their own. However, much of the agenda must be implemented collectively, which makes change enormously difficult. Moreover, the war of ideas in favor of such reforms has yet to be won. Consequently, both politics and the ruling intellectual climate make success unlikely and augur a troubled future.},

abstract = {The paper seeks to lay out a stock-flow-based theoretical framework that provides a foundation for a general theory of pricing. Contemporary marginalist economics is usually based on the assumption that prices are set in line with the value placed on goods by consumers. It does not take into account expectations, or the fact that real goods are often simultaneously assets. Meanwhile, contemporary theories of asset markets are flawed in that they either rely, implicitly or explicitly, on a market equilibrium framework or provide no framework at all. This paper offers a working alternative that relies, not on a market equilibrium framework, but rather on a stock-flow equilibrium framework. In doing so, we lay out a properly general theory of pricing that can be applied to any market—whether financial, real, or a real market that has been financialized—and which does not require that prices inevitably tend toward some prespecified market equilibrium.},

abstract = {One of the main contributions of Modern Money Theory (MMT) has been to explain why monetarily sovereign governments have a very flexible policy space that is unencumbered by hard financial constraints. Through a detailed analysis of the institutions and practices surrounding the fiscal and monetary operations of the treasury and central bank of many nations, MMT has provided institutional and theoretical insights about the inner workings of economies with monetarily sovereign and nonsovereign governments. MMT has also provided policy insights with respect to financial stability, price stability, and full employment. As one may expect, several authors have been quite critical of MMT. Critiques of MMT can be grouped into five categories: views about the origins of money and the role of taxes in the acceptance of government currency, views about fiscal policy, views about monetary policy, the relevance of MMT conclusions for developing economies, and the validity of the policy recommendations of MMT. This paper addresses the critiques raised using the circuit approach and national accounting identities, and by progressively adding additional economic sectors.},

abstract = {Standard presentations of stock-flow consistent modelling use specific Post-Keynesian closures, even though a given stock-flow accounting structure supports various different economic dynamics. We separate the dynamic closure from the accounting constraints, and cast the latter in the language of graph theory. The graph formulation provides: a representation of an economy as a collection of cash flows on a network, and a collection of algebraic techniques to identify independent vs. dependent cash flow variables and solve the accounting constraints. The separation into independent and dependent variables is not unique, and we argue that each such separation can be interpreted as an institutional structure or policy regime. Questions about macroeconomic regime change can thus be addressed in this framework. We illustrate the graph tools by application to the simplest "model SIM" of Godley and Lavoie (2007). In the case of model SIM there are eight different possible dynamic closures of the same underlying accounting structure. We classify the possible closures and discuss in detail three of them: the "standard" Godley-Lavoie closure where government spending is the key policy lever, an "austerity" regime where government spending adjusts to taxes which depend on private sector decisions, and a "colonial" regime which is driven by taxation.},

These decompositions can provide a richer and timelier view of developments in both foreign portfolio investment in the U.S. and U.S. portfolio investment abroad than available from transactions data or survey data alone. Data on cross-border holdings through December 2013, by country, are available for download; we also provide advice on how to construct estimates going forward.

abstract = {This essay argues that the Achilles heel of the international monetary and financial system is that it amplifies the “excess financial elasticity” of domestic policy regimes, ie it exacerbates their inability to prevent the build-up of financial imbalances, or outsize financial cycles, that lead to serious financial crises and macroeconomic dislocations. This excess financial elasticity view contrasts sharply with two more popular ones, which stress the failure of the system to prevent disruptive current account imbalances and its tendency to generate a structural shortage of safe assets – the “excess saving” and “excess demand for safe assets” views, respectively. In particular, the excess financial elasticity view highlights financial rather than current account imbalances and a persistent expansionary rather than contractionary bias in the system. The failure to adjust domestic policy regimes and their international interaction raises a number of risks: entrenching instability in the global system; returning to the modern-day equivalent of the divisive competitive devaluations of the interwar years; and, ultimately, triggering an epoch-defining seismic rupture in policy regimes, back to an era of trade and financial protectionism and, possibly, stagnation combined with inflation.},

abstract = {In analysing the performance of the international monetary and financial system (IMFS), too much attention has been paid to the current account and far too little to the capital account. This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises - its "excess financial elasticity". And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis},

The ESFF framework combines various fundamental features of post-Keynesian and ecological economics, most notably the consideration of macroeconomy as an open subsystem of the closed ecosystem, the impact of aggregate demand on economic growth and employment, the biophysical limits to economic activity, the effects of finance on growth and the importance of the laws of thermodynamics. It is argued that the ESFF framework provides a quite rich platform for the analysis of the complex interactions between the macroeconomy and the ecosystem. Key},

Also Keen studied the monetary paradox and contrary to circuitists he came to the conclusion that capitalists can make monetary profit with a possibility to earn enough to repay their debt and with positive balances for all actors. The author will prove that Keen made a fundamental mistake and is using the Stock Flow Consistency Principle in an inconsistent way by combining it with behavior equations in a dynamic model. So the solution presented here is not only showing that the numbers are incorrect but the method itself. This resolves a contraction between Keen and circuitists and implies that, in a Wicksellian pure credit economy, it remains impossible to gain a monetary profit for all actors. More precisely that the total sum of monetary profit over all actors is zero},

It examines first the approaches that regard financial crises as a disturbing factor of a generally stable real economy (Wicksell, Hayek, Schumpeter, Fisher, and the early Keynes). Thereafter, approaches, where the dichotomy between the monetary and the real sphere is lifted are reviewed. Here in particular the later works of Keynes and the contributions of Minsky are of importance. Lastly, it is looked at the behavioural finance approaches. After having reviewed the different approaches it is examined, where those approaches have similarities and where they fruitfully can be combined. Based on this, we develop an own theoretical framework methodologically based on a Wicksellian cumulative process, however, overcoming the neoclassical dichotomy. The paper ends with some policy recommendations based on the developed theoretical framework.},

Comparative case studies of the Great Depression, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the Japanese crisis of the 1990s and 2000s are presented. The following questions are asked: What triggered big financial crises? Which factors intensified financial crises? And most importantly, which factors prevented the return of prosperity for a long time? The main conclusion is that stagnation after big financial crises becomes likely when the balance sheets of economic units are not quickly cleaned, when the nominal wage anchor breaks, and when there is no big and longer growth stimulus by the state. Some tentative conclusions for the subprime financial crisis and the Great Recession are drawn.},

abstract = {Headline findings 1. There is currently a window of opportunity to put the UK economy decisively on a trajectory towards low-carbon prosperity, resource security and environmental quality: interest rates are low and, with still under-utilised resources, the benefits of stimulating directed investment can be large. 2. A green economy strategy can strengthen the UK economy by addressing major long- term weaknesses, particularly under-investment in infrastructure and under-performance in innovation. A credible, long-term strategy, supported by environmental tax reform, can thus deliver a more soundly-based recovery, economically as well as environmentally. 3. Government should take a more proactive, strategic approach to driving green innovation. A green industrial strategy can help to strengthen the UK innovation system and secure comparative advantage in key sectors and areas of technology that enhance resource productivity, but global competition in these areas is intensifying. 4. Government should adopt a clearer approach to prioritisation of key infrastructure projects, and ensure that infrastructure investments are compatible with long-term green economy objectives. Going beyond the undifferentiated infrastructure list in the UK Infrastructure Plan, the Government needs to identify what green infrastructure investments are required and prioritise these accordingly in order to ensure policy clarity and credibility. 5. A new information infrastructure is required to facilitate the evolution of a greener economy. Current national accounting practices and corporate reporting rules were largely developed at a time when the economic and social importance of environment and resource issues was less well recognised than it is today. Government should develop comprehensive natural capital and material flow accounts for the UK economy.},

Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions--banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they "multiply up" central bank money to create new loans and deposits. The amount of money created in the economy ultimately depends on the monetary policy of the central bank. In normal times, this is carried out by setting interest rates. The central bank can also affect the amount of money directly through purchasing assets or "quantitative easing."},

abstract = {How do aggregate wealth-to-income ratios evolve in the long run and why? We address this question using 1970–2010 national balance sheets recently compiled in the top eight developed economies. For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise‘ of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200–300{\%} in 1970 to 400–600{\%} in 2010. In effect, today’s ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600–700{\%}). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the ?¼s g Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s¼10{\%}, the long-run wealth-income ratio ? is about 300{\%} if g¼3{\%} and 600{\%} if g¼1.5{\%}. Our results have implications for capital taxation and regu- lation and shed new light on the changing nature of wealth, the shape of the production function, and the rise of capital shares.},

abstract = {The shadow banking system can broadly be described as credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system. Intermediating credit through nonbank channels can have important advantages and contributes to the financing of the real economy, but such channels can also become a source of systemic risk, especially when they are structured to perform bank-like functions (e.g. maturity transformation and leverage) and when their interconnectedness with the regular banking system is strong. Therefore, appropriate monitoring of shadow banking helps to mitigate the build-up of such systemic risks. The FSB set out its approach for monitoring the global shadow banking system in its report to the G20 in October 2011. 2 This report presents the results of the third annual monitoring exercise following this approach, using end-2012 data. The report includes data from 25 jurisdictions and the euro area as a whole, bringing the coverage of the monitoring exercise to about 80{\%} of global GDP and 90{\%} of global financial system assets.5 As in previous exercises, the primary focus of the monitoring is a ‘macro-mapping’ based on national Flow of Funds and Sector Balance Sheet data (hereafter Flow of Funds), that looks at all non-bank financial intermediation6 to provide a conservative estimate which ensures that data gathering and surveillance cover the areas where shadow banking-related risks to the financial system might potentially arise.7 Sections 2 to 4 and Section 6 of the report present the result of the macro-mapping, including size and growth trends of the shadow banking system, cross-jurisdiction analysis, trends in sub-sectors and interconnectedness with the banking system.},

@article{Sornette2014,
abstract = {We define a financial bubble as a period of unsustainable growth, when the price of an asset increases ever more quickly, in a series of accelerating phases of corrections and rebounds. More technically, during a bubble phase, the price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often accompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a change of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they leave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is, before they burst. In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind financial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power law emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are, as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific trading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major correction, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards maturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles and to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. The tools that are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose. They are at the core of the Financial Crisis Observatory at the ETH Zurich, where tens of thousands of assets are monitored on a daily basis. This allow us to have a continuous overview of emerging bubbles in the global financial markets. The companion report available as part of the Notenstein white paper series (2014) with the title ``Financial bubbles: mechanism, diagnostic and state of the World (Feb. 2014)'' presents a practical application of the methodology outlines in this article and describes our view of the status concerning positive and negative bubbles in the financial markets, as of the end of January 2014.},

abstract = {This paper examines the monetary policy constraints facing economies on a fixed peg or managed float regime, contrasting the Mundell-Fleming Trilemma view against the Compensation view commonly found at central banks. While the former holds that balance-of-payments disequilibria directly affect domestic monetary policy un- der non-floating regimes, causing a loss of autonomy unless capital controls are ad- opted, the latter purports that endogenous sterilization of financial flows invalidates this trade-off, making the balance-of-payments position a more binding constraint on an economy’s autonomy than its choice of exchange rate regime. The predic- tions of both theories are empirically evaluated for five East Asian economies using central bank balance sheets, vector error correction models and impulse response functions. The findings indicate that the dynamics for the economies studied cor- respond more closely to the Compensation view than the Trilemma view, suggesting that non-floating regimes may be less costly in autonomy terms than traditionally assumed.},

Furthermore, the wealth of shareholders increases because of higher capital gains. Nevertheless, higher leverage that reduces the quality of businessmen creditworthiness renders the economy financially fragile. We argue that a higher value of Veblen’s Q reduces the quality of leverage that is in turn positively associated with higher non-performing loans and defaults. De-leverage negatively affects income distribution, the rate of accumulation and the macroeconomy.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to international finance is to view capital flows as the financial counterpart to savings and investment decisions, assuming further that the GDP boundary defines both the decision-making unit and the currency area. This "triple coincidence" of GDP area, decision-making unit and currency area is an elegant simplification but misleads when financial flows are important in their own right. First, the neglect of gross flows, when only net flows are considered, can lead to misdiagnoses of financial vulnerability. Second, inattention to the effects of international currencies may lead to erroneous conclusions on exchange rate adjustment. Third, sectoral differences between corporate and official sector positions can distort welfare conclusions on the consequences of currency depreciation, as macroeconomic risks may be underestimated. This paper illustrates the pitfalls of the triple coincidence through a series of examples from the global financial system in recent years and examines alternative analytical frameworks based on balance sheets as the unit of analysis},

abstract = {Leading up to the 2007 financial crisis, housing prices in the United States had climbed to unprecedented levels. This was a highly speculative market. Within the post-Keynesian stock- flow consistent (PK-SFC) literature, models focused on speculation in the housing market are quite limited. This paper presents a new stock-flow consistent model, influenced by Gennaro Zezza’s paper U.S. growth, the housing market, and the distribution of income (2008) and the textbook for stock-flow consistent modelling: Monetary Economics, An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth, 2nd Edition coauthored by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie. The main contribution of this model to existing literature is a new behaviour of the firm in the production and setting of the price of houses. The result is a model that creates business cycles driven by speculation in the housing market, without any exogenous shocks imposed on the model. The first section begins with a brief history and discussion of SFC modelling. The second section is a literature review of SFC models focused on the housing market. The third section is a brief review of U.S. housing data, building the foundation for a theoretical argument about what caused the rise of U.S. house prices. In the fourth section a new SFC model focused on the housing market is presented. The final section is a discussion of the simulations of the baseline model and the three shocks imposed on the model},

abstract = {Navigating the transformation towards a sustainable economy requires a macroeconomic theory capable of robustly dealing with issues of energy use and emissions, but much of economic theory underemphasizes the importance of energy and natural resources. This paper suggests one alternative route to an ecological macroeconomic model with Keynesian features. Post-Keynesian economics and ecological economics share substantial common ground, similarities include consumption and production theory, and the importance of instability, irreversibility and uncertainty. However, Post-Keynesians have heretofore tended to neglect the ecological dimension of the economy. Keynesian macroeconomic theory places great emphasis on the determination of a level of effective demand commensurate with key economic policy goals, but the ecological implications of those economic policy goals have often been neglected. This paper proposes a synthesis of post-Keynesian Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) models and Input–Output (IO) models that investigate sectoral interdependencies within the real economy. We present a conceptual model to simultaneously study monetary flows through the financial system, flows of produced goods and services through the real economy, and flows of physical materials through the natural environment. We analyze the model using concepts from dynamical system theory and apply it to energy related problems.},

abstract = {The paper proposes a post-Keynesian framework to explain Tobin’s q behaviour in the long run. The theoretical basis is informed by the Cambridge corporate model originally proposed by Kaldor (1966), which is reinterpreted here as a theory for q. The core of the ‘Kaldorian q theory’ is a negative long-run relation between q and growth rates, a negative relation between q and propensities to consume, and the fact that q can be different from 1 in the long-run equilibrium. We generalise this model through a medium-scale Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) model, which introduces important post-Keynesian aspects missing in the Kaldorian model, such as endogenous money, a financial system and inflation. We extend the model to include a more realistic treatment of firms’ financial structure decisions and allow the interdependence between these decisions and dividend policy. Numerical simulations confirm that the original Kaldorian relations between q and growth rates and propensities to consume hold, but unlike the original model, in our model q is not independent of how firms finance their investment. We also confirm the possibility of q being different from 1 in the long-run. Finally, we contrast this ‘post-Keynesian q theory’ with the Miller-Modigliani dividend irrelevance proposition and the neoclassical investment and financial theory. It is shown that its validity depends crucially on the value taken by q: for q values different from 1 the proposition will not hold and dividend policy will be relevant for equity valuation. Therefore, post-Keynesian q theory stands against the main predictions of mainstream finance and constitutes an alternative for developing a macroeconomic theory for equity markets.},

abstract = {Monetary circuit theory is one of the most known attempts to formally describe the functioning of a monetary production economy as centered around the concept of flux-reflux of money. Endogenous money creation by commercial banks allows the circuit to open and firms to implement production processes. Financial markets ‘passively’ close the circuit by intermediating savings via bond and equity issuance. Despite its natural focus on financial-real side links, the monetary circuit literature has paid relatively little attention to ‘financialization’ and the way it has modified real-financial dynamics. In this paper, we analyze whether the flux-reflux perspective of the circuit may be fruitfully applied to the description of the real-financial linkages in a financialized economy. We propose two interconnected circuits, one for the real economy and one for the financial one. In this context, finance can still ensure a consistent closure of the whole system, thus directly allowing the functioning of the real economy. Newly developed inside-finance interactions, however, may indirectly influence real world dynamics by easing/restricting access to credit/financial markets and give rise to boom-and-bust cycles. Our aim is twofold: modeling modern financial worlds within a MC framework and understanding how financialization could have modified real-financial interactions.},

abstract = {This paper examines the internal dynamics of an artificial economy by use of the stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic modelling. Two (2) financial subsectors –commercial banks and investment banks – are incorporated to delineate their interactions. The commercial banks originate mortgages, and issue mortgage-based securities (MBS) whose price is positively correlated with housing prices, while the investment banks purchase the securities. An increase in autonomous consumption by households leads to higher levels of economic activities. The time path shows cyclical dynamics resulting from investment behaviour of the producing firm sector and mortgage management of households. Commercial banks and investment banks react differently. In the new steady state, leverage of commercial banks is higher and leverage of investment banks is lower than the initial baseline levels. Changes in the interest rate on mortgages influence the time path significantly. A lower interest rate on mortgages increases housing demand, and output goes up. Both housing prices and security prices decrease, which lowers the net worth of investment banks goes up in the new steady state. A lower MBS price decreases the net worth of investment banks and increases leverage, which pushes down housing demand, and mortgage demand decreases. Therefore, output and household income decline. Commercial banks’ leverage is higher, while investment banks’ leverage is lower than that in the initial baseline solution. The model demonstrates that investment banks are counter-cyclical with asset management and price changes in MBS. However, financial factors can act as sources of financial fragility. investment banks. The leverage of},

abstract = {Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) holds that governments with sovereign currencies and flexible exchange rate regimes can run deficits without worrying about possible default, maintaining a desired interest rate set by the monetary authorities. We sympathize with calls for tests of such a system within the context of a full macro model. We first adopt a neo-Kaleckian growth model with sovereign currency and government production. Using analytical methods, we investigate potential and putative instabilities and dynamical properties related to stock-flow inconsistency, distributional drift, poor policy settings, and others. We also lay out a larger stock-flow consistent post-Keynesian (SFC-PK) model from a recent working paper [Hannsgen and Young-Taft 2015]. This model requires a historical- time approach that relies on numerical solution techniques and goes beyond the steady-state fiscal sustainability formulas of Domar, allowing for path dependency, etc. The model keeps track of simulated amounts of accumulated greenhouse-gas emissions, along with inflation, the growth rate, the wage-share, the profit rate, etc., in the model economy. This model also makes use of a Poisson model of financial crises/shocks, which generates crises/shocks whose exact timing depends on chance.},

Keynes’s understanding of the nature of probability allows a clear distinction to be made between debt and equity finance which most economists dismiss. Rather than meriting remuneration, the demand for the security provided by money against an uncertain future imposes a social cost in one form or another. This proposition is illustrated with reference to the problems of the modern international financial and monetary system, specifically the role of deposit insurance and the obstacles to a renewed system of managed exchange rates, without which many regions appear doomed to enduring long-term austerity.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to model the macroeconomic effects of sovereign ratings. Operating in the context of deregulated financial markets, credit rating agencies do not only ‘provide an opinion’, but also shape the views of investors and the public. Even more, by setting rating scores for entire sovereign states, rating agencies come to have a significant impact on macroeconomic dynamics. By utilizing a two-country stock flow consistent model that approximates Eurozone, my paper connects the movements of ratings with the dynamics of the financial market and the constraints for fiscal policy. With endogenous fiscal expenditures and with an endogenous rating mechanism, my model shows how following a recessionary shock, severe downgrades of a country can influence the liquidity preference of investors. Such influence comes to deepen the already ongoing recession by impeding the state’s access to financial resources and pushing it to implement fiscal austerity. Besides the baseline scenario where investors switch from downgraded bills to cash, an alternative closure is established whereby investors transfer their funds to better quality bills. Furthermore a scenario of ‘nervous’ rating agencies is also considered. Simulation results support the key insights of the current under all specifications},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Moreover, there is a striking resemblance in the development of net savings of firms’ on the one hand and the surplus on the current account on the balance of payments on the other. Both have increased to almost 10 per cent of GDP in recent years. Next to that, the housing boom household net-savings have decreased prior to 2007 following the housing boom, accompanied by an increase in government net-savings. These trends reversed thereafter due to the bursting of the housing bubble. We present a stock-flow consistent model of the firm to explain firms’ excess savings, inspired by Hein (2012), and embed that in an open economy model with a banking sector which we have developed earlier. This enables us to model the preference of firms to invest in financial assets abroad and to analyse the close link between firms’ excess savings and the current account surplus. As a consequence we also explain the close link between net household savings and government budget deficit. We present simulation results to illustrate the working of our model.},

@article{Tobon2015a,
abstract = {Following recent debates on the New Neoclassical Synthesis, the theory of monetary policy has been renewed. The prevailing method, illustrated by Woodford’s version of Interest and Prices, is a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model in which the old LM curve is voluntarily substituted by an optimal monetary rule. Such a turning point requires a peculiar set of assumptions, especially regarding monetary prices. The recent debate pays attention to de-emphasis on the nominal monetary aggregate, which does not play any explicit role in monetary policy deliberations. Following Calvo’s model, Woodford’s neo-Wicksellian framework only considered monetary prices in equilibrium. This article demonstrates that even though the New Neoclassical Synthesis considers it essential to have a monetary theory for policymaking, the former offers the same answers as the traditional static macroeconomics. More precisely, it shows that the use of dynamic optimisation – such as the one developed by Woodford’s approach – does not contribute in a decisive way to improving our understanding of the role that money prices play in monetary theory. Woodford’s canvas is silent about the mechanisms whereby monetary policy induces agents to adjust individual money prices to the values that generate an equilibrium price level. Thus, if we want to close this gap, it may be useful to consider a ‘forward guidance’ strategy. By means of such a tool, central bankers are able to shape the public’s expectations on economic outcomes by pre-announcing the time path of future policy actions.},

abstract = {With this inquiry we seek to develop a multi-sectoral version of the static Harrod foreign trade multiplier, by showing that it can be derived from an extended version of the Pasinettian model of structural change to international trade. This new version highlights the connections between balance of payment and the level of employment and production. It is also shown that from this disaggregated version of the Harrod foreign multiplier we can drive an aggregate version of the multiplier, further developing the consistency of our analysis. By following this approach we go a step further in establishing the connections between the Structural Economic Dynamic and Balance-of-Payments Constrained Growth approaches},

@article{Valdecantos2015b,
abstract = {The emergence and persistence of large trade imbalances as well as the volatility of financial flows among countries have been attributed, at least in part, to the inadequacy of the current international monetary system after the breakdown of Bretton Woods. From a different perspective, the current eurozone crisis is also the result, in our view, of a flawed institutional setting. These problems call for reforms to mitigate or avoid the recessionary bias that is the outcome of current systems, as Keynes predicted in the discussion preceding the Bretton Woods agreements. In this paper we briefly review the evidence on international imbalances, and survey the rapidly growing literature on the subject. We introduce a set of models based on the stock-flow-consistent approach pioneered by Godley (1999) and Lavoie and Godley (2003). We discuss how to use these models to explore potential reform of the international monetary system.},

@unpublished{Hoog2015,
abstract = {This paper explores how different credit market- and banking regulations affect business fluctuations. Capital adequacy- and reserve requirements are analysed for their effect on the risk of severe downturns. We develop an agent-based macroeconomic model in which financial contagion is transmitted through balance sheets in an endogenous firm-bank network, that incorporates firm bankruptcy and heterogeneity among banks to capture the fact that contagion effects are bank-specific. Using concepts from the empirical literature to identify amplitude and duration of recessions and expansions we show that more stringent liquidity regulations are best to dampen output fluctuations and prevent severe downturns. Under such regulations both leverage along expansions and amplitude of recessions become smaller. More stringent capital requirements induce larger output fluctuations and lead to deeper, more fragile recessions. This indicates that the capital adequacy requirement is pro-cyclical and therefore not advisable as a measure to prevent financial contagion.},

@inproceedings{Wacker2015,
abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of balance of payment imbalances in the Eurozone, how they can become a particular source of vulnerability and unsustainability in a currency union, and to what extent structural and, especially, monetary policies can counteract. After recapitulating that all Euro crisis countries ran substantial current account deficits before the crisis, the paper takes a closer look at the current account of one of the most important surplus countries, Germany. I highlight that two thirds of its current account surplus with the rest of the Euro area are driven by primary income flows, especially earnings on foreign assets. A key argument is that Germany thereby exports a latent domestic liquidity trap, as the current account surplus reflects a high level of savings that the domestic economy cannot absorb in view of structural long-run challenges and lackluster domestic growth. Preventing currency appreciation through a fixed exchange rate is an indispensable element in this strategy. This situation creates a key vulnerability of the Eurozone, as Germany has an interest in keeping interest rate differentials on its net asset position high. Deficit countries, on the other hand, will find it increasingly harder to run current account surpluses the more important primary factor payments, which are highly persistent, become in their balance of payments. The last part of the paper discusses the policy options to counteract this situation. Without rejecting the importance of fiscal policy, a key argument of the paper is that monetary policy remains effective in the current situation of diverging optimal policy rates and at the zero lower bound and would allow for discussing the mandate of the ECB and its policy framework in a larger context.},
